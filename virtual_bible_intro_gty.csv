"1","1","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>The English title, Genesis, comes from the Greek translation (Septuagint, LXX)<sup>1</sup> meaning &ldquo;origins&rdquo;; whereas, the Hebrew title is derived from the Bible&rsquo;s very first word, translated &ldquo;in the beginning.&rdquo; Genesis serves to introduce the Pentateuch (the first 5 books of the OT) and the entire Bible. The influence of Genesis in Scripture is demonstrated by its being quoted over 35 times in the NT and hundreds of allusions appearing in both Testaments. The story line of salvation which begins in Gen. 3 is not completed until Rev. 21, 22 where the eternal kingdom of redeemed believers is gloriously pictured.</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>While 1) the author does not identify himself in Genesis and 2) Genesis ends almost 3 centuries before Moses was born, both the OT (Ex. 17:14; Num. 33:2; Josh. 8:31; 1 Kin. 2:3; 2 Kin. 14:6; Ezra 6:18; Neh. 13:1; Dan. 9:11, 13; Mal. 4:4) and the NT (Matt. 8:4; Mark 12:26; Luke 16:29; 24:27, 44; John 5:46; 7:22; Acts 15:1; Rom. 10:19; 1 Cor. 9:9; 2 Cor. 3:15) ascribe this composition to Moses, who is the fitting author in light of his educational background (cf. Acts 7:22). No compelling reasons have been forthcoming to challenge Mosaic authorship. Genesis was written after the Exodus (ca. 1445 B.C.), but before Moses&rsquo; death (ca. 1405 B.C.). For a brief biographical sketch of Moses read Ex. 1&ndash;6.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>The initial setting for Genesis is eternity past. God then, by willful act and divine Word, spoke all creation into existence, furnished it, and finally breathed life into a lump of dirt which He fashioned in His image to become Adam. God made mankind the crowning point of His creation, i.e., His companions who would enjoy fellowship with Him and bring glory to His name. The historical background for the early events in Genesis is clearly Mesopotamian. While it is difficult to pinpoint precisely the historical moment for which this book was written, Israel first heard Genesis sometime prior to crossing the Jordan River and entering the Promised Land (ca. 1405 B.C.). Genesis has 3 distinct, sequential geographical settings: 1) Mesopotamia (chaps. 1&ndash;11); 2) the Promised Land (chaps. 12&ndash;36); and 3) Egypt (chaps. 37&ndash;50). The time frames of these 3 segments are: 1) Creation to ca. 2090 B.C.; 2) 2090&ndash;1897 B.C.; and 3) 1897&ndash;1804 B.C. Genesis covers more time than the remaining books of the Bible combined.</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>In this book of beginnings, God revealed Himself and a worldview to Israel which contrasted, at times sharply, with the worldview of Israel&rsquo;s neighbors. The author made no attempt to defend the existence of God or to present a systematic discussion of His person and works. Rather, Israel&rsquo;s God distinguished Himself clearly from the alleged gods of her neighbors. Theological foundations are revealed which include God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit, man, sin, redemption, covenant, promise, Satan and angels, kingdom, revelation, Israel, judgment, and blessing.</p><p>Genesis 1&ndash;11 (primeval history) reveals the origins of the universe, i.e., the beginnings of time and space and many of the firsts in human experience, such as marriage, family, the Fall, sin, redemption, judgment, and nations. Genesis 12&ndash;50 (patriarchal history) explained to Israel how they came into existence as a family whose ancestry could be traced to Eber (hence the &ldquo;Hebrews&rdquo;; Gen. 10:24, 25) and even more remotely to Shem, the son of Noah (hence the &ldquo;Semites&rdquo;; Gen. 10:21). God&rsquo;s people came to understand not only their ancestry and family history, but also the origins of their institutions, customs, languages, and different cultures, especially basic human experiences such as sin and death.</p><p>Because they were preparing to enter Canaan and dispossess the Canaanite inhabitants of their homes and properties, God revealed their enemies&rsquo; background. In addition, they needed to understand the actual basis of the war they were about to declare in light of the immorality of killing, consistent with the other 4 books that Moses was writing (Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy). Ultimately, the Jewish nation would understand a selected portion of preceding world history and the inaugural background of Israel as a basis by which they would live in their new beginnings under Joshua&rsquo;s leadership in the land which had previously been promised to their original patriarchal forefather, Abraham.</p><p>Genesis 12:1&ndash;3 established a primary focus on God&rsquo;s promises to Abraham. This narrowed their view from the entire world of peoples in Gen. 1&ndash;11 to one small nation, Israel, through whom God would progressively accomplish His redemptive plan. This underscored Israel&rsquo;s mission to be &ldquo;a light to the Gentiles&rdquo; (Is. 42:6). God promised land, descendants (seed), and blessing. This 3-fold promise became, in turn, the basis of the covenant with Abraham (Gen. 15:1&ndash;20). The rest of Scripture bears out the fulfillment of these promises.</p><p>On a larger scale, Gen. 1&ndash;11 set forth a singular message about the character and works of God. In the sequence of accounts which make up these chapters of Scripture, a pattern emerges which reveals God&rsquo;s abundant grace as He responded to the willful disobedience of mankind. Without exception, in each account God increased the manifestation of His grace. But also without exception, man responded in greater sinful rebellion. In biblical words, the more sin abounded the more did God&rsquo;s grace abound (cf. Rom. 5:20).</p><p>One final theme of both theological and historical significance sets Genesis apart from other books of Scripture, in that the first book of Scripture corresponds closely with the final book. In the book of Revelation, the paradise which was lost in Genesis will be regained. The apostle John clearly presented the events recorded in his book as future resolutions to the problems which began as a result of the curse in Gen. 3. His focus is upon the effects of the Fall in the undoing of creation and the manner in which God rids His creation of the curse effect. In John&rsquo;s own words, &ldquo;And there shall be no more curse&rdquo; (Rev. 22:3). Not surprisingly, in the final chapter of God&rsquo;s Word, believers will find themselves back in the Garden of Eden, the eternal paradise of God, eating from the tree of life (Rev. 22:1&ndash;14). At that time, they will partake, wearing robes washed in the blood of the Lamb (Rev. 22:14).</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>Grasping the individual messages of Genesis which make up the larger plan and purpose of the book presents no small challenge since both the individual accounts and the book&rsquo;s overall message offer important lessons to faith and works. Genesis presents creation by divine fiat, <em>ex nihilo</em>, i.e., &ldquo;out of nothing.&rdquo; Three traumatic events of epic proportions, namely the Fall, the universal Flood, and the Dispersion of nations are presented as historical backdrop in order to understand world history. From Abraham on, the pattern is to focus on God&rsquo;s redemption and blessing. The customs of Genesis often differ considerably from those of our modern day. They must be explained against their ancient Near Eastern background. Each custom must be treated according to the immediate context of the passage before any attempt is made to explain it based on customs recorded in extrabiblical sources or even elsewhere in Scripture.</p><p>1.

Primitive history records 4 major events: 1) Creation (Gen. 1, 2); 2) the Fall (Gen. 3&ndash;5); 3) the Flood (Gen. 6&ndash;9); and 4) the Dispersion (Gen. 10, 11). Patriarchal history spotlights 4 great men: 1) Abraham (Gen. 12:1&ndash;25:8); 2) Isaac (Gen. 21:1&ndash;35:29); 3) Jacob (Gen. 25:21&ndash;50:14); and 4) Joseph (Gen. 30:22&ndash;50:26).</p><p>The literary structure of Genesis is built on the frequently recurring phrase &ldquo;the history/genealogy of&rdquo; and is the basis for the following outline:</p><p><strong>I.

"2","2","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>The Greek Septuagint (LXX)<sup>1</sup> and the Latin Vulgate versions of the OT assigned the title &ldquo;Exodus&rdquo; to this second book of Moses, because the departure of Israel from Egypt is the dominant historical fact in the book (19:1). In the Hebrew Bible, the opening words, &ldquo;And (or Now) these are the names,&rdquo; served as the title of the book. The opening &ldquo;And&rdquo; or &ldquo;Now&rdquo; in the Hebrew title suggests that this book was to be accepted as the obvious sequel to Genesis, the first book of Moses. Hebrews 11:22 commends the faith of Joseph who, while on his deathbed (ca. 1804 B.C.), spoke of the &ldquo;departure&rdquo; or the &ldquo;exiting&rdquo; of the sons of Israel, looking ahead over 350 years to the Exodus (ca. 1445 B.C.).</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>Mosaic authorship of Exodus is unhesitatingly affirmed. Moses followed God&rsquo;s instructions and &ldquo;wrote all the words of the LORD&rdquo; (24:4), which included at the least the record of the battle with Amalek (17:14), the Ten Commandments (34:4, 27&ndash;29), and the Book of the Covenant (20:22&ndash;23:33). Similar assertions of Mosaic writing occur elsewhere in the Pentateuch: Moses is identified as the one who recorded the &ldquo;starting points of their journeys&rdquo; (Num. 33:2) and who &ldquo;wrote this law&rdquo; (Deut. 31:9).</p><p>The OT corroborates Mosaic authorship of the portions mentioned above (see Josh. 1:7, 8; 8:31, 32; 1 Kin. 2:3; 2 Kin. 14:6; Neh. 13:1; Dan. 9:11&ndash;13; and Mal. 4:4). The NT concurs by citing Ex. 3:6 as part of &ldquo;the book of Moses&rdquo; (Mark. 12:26), by assigning Ex. 13:2 to &ldquo;the law of Moses,&rdquo; which is also referred to as &ldquo;the law of the Lord&rdquo; (Luke 2:22, 23), by ascribing Ex. 20:12 and 21:17 to Moses (Mark 7:10), by attributing the law to Moses (John 7:19; Rom. 10:5), and by Jesus&rsquo; specifically declaring that Moses had written of Him (John 5:46, 47).</p><p>At some time during his 40 year tenure as Israel&rsquo;s leader, beginning at 80 years of age and ending at 120 (7:7; Deut. 34:7), Moses wrote down this second of his 5 books. More specifically, it would have been after the Exodus and obviously before his death on Mt. Nebo in the plains of Moab. The date of the Exodus (ca. 1445 B.C.) dictates the date of the writing in the 15th century B.C.</p><p>Scripture dates Solomon&rsquo;s fourth year of reign, when he began to build the temple (ca. 966/65 B.C.), as being 480 years after the Exodus (1 Kin. 6:1), establishing the early date of 1445 B.C. Jephthah noted that, by his day, Israel had possessed Heshbon for 300 years (Judg. 11:26). Calculating backward and forward from Jephthah, and taking into account different periods of foreign oppression, judgeships and kingships, the wilderness wanderings, and the initial entry and conquest of Canaan under Joshua, this early date is confirmed and amounts to 480 years.</p><p>Scripture also dates the entry of Jacob and his extended family into Egypt (ca. 1875B.C.) as being 430 years before the Exodus (12:40), thus placing Joseph in what archeologists have designated as the 12th Dynasty, the Middle Kingdom period of Egyptian history, and placing Moses and Israel&rsquo;s final years of residence and slavery in what archeologists have designated as the 18th Dynasty, or New Kingdom period. Further, Joseph&rsquo;s stint as vizier over all of Egypt (Gen. 45:8) precludes his having served under the Hyksos (ca. 1730&ndash;1570 B.C.), the foreign invaders who ruled during a period of confusion in Egypt and who never controlled all of the country. They were a mixed Semitic race who introduced the horse and chariot as well as the composite bow. These implements of war made possible their expulsion from Egypt.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>Eighteenth Dynasty Egypt, the setting for Israel&rsquo;s dramatic departure, was not a politically or economically weak and obscure period of Egyptian history. Thutmose III, for example, the Pharaoh of the Oppression has been called the &ldquo;Napoleon of Ancient Egypt,&rdquo; the sovereign who expanded the boundaries of Egyptian influence far beyond natural borders. This was the dynasty which over a century before, under the leadership of Amose I, had expelled the Hyksos kings from the country and redirected the country&rsquo;s economic, military, and diplomatic growth. At the time of the Exodus, Egypt was strong, not weak.</p><p>Moses, born in 1525 B.C. (80 years old in 1445 B.C.), became &ldquo;learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians&rdquo; (Acts 7:22) while growing up in the courts of Pharaohs Thutmose I and II and Queen Hatshepsut for his first 40 years (Acts 7:23). He was in self-imposed, Midianite exile during the reign of Thutmose III for another 40 years (Acts 7:30), and returned at God&rsquo;s direction to be Israel&rsquo;s leader early in the reign of Amenhotep II, the pharaoh of the Exodus. God used both the educational system of Egypt and his exile in Midian to prepare Moses to represent his people before a powerful pharaoh and to guide his people through the wilderness of the Sinai peninsula during his final 40 years (Acts 7:36). Moses died on Mt. Nebo when he was 120 years old (Deut. 34:1&ndash;6), as God&rsquo;s judgment was on him for his anger and disrespect (Num. 20:1&ndash;3). While he looked on from afar, Moses never entered the Promised Land. Centuries later he appeared to the disciples on the Mt. of Transfiguration (Matt. 17:3).</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>In God&rsquo;s timing, the Exodus marked the end of a period of oppression for Abraham&rsquo;s descendants (Gen. 15:13), and constituted the beginning of the fulfillment of the covenant promise to Abraham that his descendants would not only reside in the Promised Land, but would also multiply and become a great nation (Gen. 12:1&ndash;3, 7). The purpose of the book may be expressed like this: To trace the rapid growth of Jacob&rsquo;s descendants from Egypt to the establishment of the theocratic nation in their Promised Land.</p><p>At appropriate times, on Mt. Sinai and in the plains of Moab, God also gave the Israelites that body of legislation, the law, which they needed for living properly in Israel as the theocratic people of God. By this, they were distinct from all other nations (Deut. 4:7, 8; Rom. 9:4, 5).</p><p>By God&rsquo;s self-revelation, the Israelites were instructed in the sovereignty and majesty, the goodness and holiness, and the grace and mercy of their Lord, the one and only God of heaven and earth (see especially Ex. 3, 6, 33, 34). The account of the Exodus and the events that followed are also the subject of other major biblical revelation (cf. Pss. 105:25&ndash;45; 106:6&ndash;27; Acts 7:17&ndash;44; 1 Cor. 10:1&ndash;13; Heb. 9:1&ndash;6; 11:23&ndash;29).</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>The absence of any Egyptian record of the devastation of Egypt by the 10 plagues and the major defeat of Pharaoh&rsquo;s elite army at the Red Sea should not give rise to speculation on whether the account is historically authentic. Egyptian historiography did not permit records of their pharaohs&rsquo; embarrassments and ignominious defeats to be published. In recording the Conquest under Joshua, Scripture specifically notes the three cities which Israel destroyed and burned (Josh. 6:24; 8:28; 11:11&ndash;13). The Conquest, after all, was one of takeover and inhabitation of property virtually intact, not a war designed to destroy. The date of Israel&rsquo;s march into Canaan will not be confirmed, therefore, by examining extensive burn levels at city-sites of a later period.</p><p>Despite the absence of any extrabiblical, ancient Near Eastern records of the Hebrew bondage, the plagues, the Exodus, and the Conquest, archeological evidence corroborates the early date. All the pharaohs, for example, of the 15th century left evidence of interest in building enterprises in Lower Egypt. These projects were obviously accessible to Moses in the Delta region near Goshen.</p><p>The typological significance of the tabernacle has occasioned much reflection. Ingenuity in linking every item of furniture and every piece of building material to Christ may appear most intriguing, but if NT statements and allusions do not support such linkage and typology then hermeneutical caution must rule. The tabernacle&rsquo;s structure and ornamentation for efficiency and beauty are one thing, but finding hidden meaning and symbolism is unfounded. How the sacrificial and worship system of the tabernacle and its parts meaningfully typify the redeeming work of the coming Messiah must be left to those NT passages which treat the subject.</p><br /><p>1.

"3","3","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>The original Hebrew title of this third book of the law is taken from the first word, translated &ldquo;And He called.&rdquo; Several OT books derive their Hebrew names in the same manner (e.g., Genesis, &ldquo;In the beginning&rdquo;; Exodus, &ldquo;Now these are the names&rdquo;). The title &ldquo;Leviticus&rdquo; comes from the Latin Vulgate version of the Greek OT (LXX)<sup>1</sup> <em>Leuitikon</em> meaning &ldquo;matters of the Levites&rdquo; (25:32, 33). While the book addresses issues of the Levites&rsquo; responsibilities, much more significantly, all the priests are instructed in how they are to assist the people in worship, and the people are informed about how to live a holy life. New Testament writers quote the book of Leviticus over 15 times.</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>Authorship and date issues are resolved by the concluding verse of the book, &ldquo;These are the commandments which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel on Mount Sinai&rdquo; (27:34; cf. 7:38; 25:1; 26:46). The fact that God gave these laws to Moses (cf. 1:1) appears56 times in Leviticus&rsquo; 27 chapters. In addition to recording detailed prescriptions, the book chronicles several historical accounts relating to the laws (see 8&ndash;10; 24:10&ndash;23). The Exodus occurred in 1445 B.C. (see Introduction to Exodus: Author and Date) and the tabernacle was finished one year later (Ex. 40:17). Leviticus picks up the record at that point, probably revealed in the first month (Abib/Nisan) of the second year after the Exodus. The book of Numbers begins after that in the second month (Ziv; cf. Num. 1:1).</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>Before the year that Israel camped at Mt. Sinai: 1) the presence of God&rsquo;s glory had never formally resided among the Israelites; 2) a central place of worship, like the tabernacle, had never existed; 3) a structured and regulated set of sacrifices and feasts had not been given; and 4) a High-Priest, a formal priesthood, and a cadre of tabernacle workers had not been appointed. As Exodus concluded, features one and two had been accomplished, thereby requiring that elements three and four be inaugurated, which is where Leviticus fits in. Exodus 19:6 called Israel to be &ldquo;a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.&rdquo; Leviticus in turn is God&rsquo;s instruction for His newly redeemed people, teaching them how to worship and obey Him.</p><p>Israel had, up to that point, only the historical records of the patriarchs from which to gain their knowledge of how to worship and live before their God. Having been slaves for centuries in Egypt, the land of a seemingly infinite number of gods, their concept of worship and the godly life was severely distorted. Their tendency to hold on to polytheism and pagan ritual is witnessed in the wilderness wanderings, e.g., when they worshiped the golden calf (cf. Ex. 32). God would not permit them to worship in the ways of their Egyptian neighbors, nor would He tolerate Egyptian ideas about morality and sin. With the instructions in Leviticus, the priests could lead Israel in worship appropriate to the Lord.</p><p>Even though the book contains a great deal of law, it is presented in a historical format. Immediately after Moses supervised the construction of the tabernacle, God came in glory to dwell there; this marked the close of the book of Exodus (40:34&ndash;38). Leviticus begins with God calling Moses from the tabernacle and ends with God&rsquo;s commands to Moses in the form of binding legislation. Israel&rsquo;s King had occupied His palace (the tabernacle), instituted His law, and declared Himself a covenant partner with His subjects.</p><p>No geographical movement occurs in this book. The people of Israel stay at the foot of Sinai, the mountain where God came down to give His law (25:1; 26:46; 27:34). They were still there one month later when the record of Numbers began (cf. Num. 1:1).</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>The core ideas around which Leviticus develops are the holy character of God and the will of God for Israel&rsquo;s holiness. God&rsquo;s holiness, mankind&rsquo;s sinfulness, sacrifice, and God&rsquo;s presence in the sanctuary are the book&rsquo;s most common themes. With a clear, authoritative tone, the book sets forth instruction toward personal holiness at the urging of God (11:44, 45; 19:2; 20:7, 26; cf. 1 Pet. 1:14&ndash;16). Matters pertaining to Israel&rsquo;s life of faith tend to focus on purity in ritual settings, but not to the exclusion of concerns regarding Israel&rsquo;s personal purity. In fact, there is a continuing emphasis on personal holiness in response to the holiness of God (cf. this emphasis in chaps. 17&ndash;27). On over 125 occasions, Leviticus indicts mankind for uncleanness and/or instructs on how to be purified. The motive for such holiness is stated in two repeated phrases: &ldquo;I am the LORD&rdquo; and &ldquo;I am holy.&rdquo; These are used over 50 times.</p><p>The theme of the conditional Mosaic Covenant resurfaces throughout the book, but particularly in chap. 26. This contract for the new nation not only details the consequences for obedience or disobedience to the covenant stipulations, but it does so in a manner scripted for determining Israel&rsquo;s history. One cannot help but recognize prophetic implications in the punishments for disobedience; they sound like the events of the much later Babylonian deportment, captivity, and subsequent return to the land almost 900 years after Moses wrote Leviticus (ca. 538 B.C.). The eschatological implications for Israel&rsquo;s disobedience will not conclude until Messiah comes to introduce His kingdom and end the curses of Lev. 26 and Deut. 28 (cf. Zech. 14:11).</p><p>The 5 sacrifices and offerings were symbolic. Their design was to allow the truly penitent and thankful worshiper to express faith in and love for God by the observance of these rituals. When the heart was not penitent and thankful, God was not pleased with the ritual. Cf. Amos 5:21&ndash;27. The offerings were burnt, symbolizing the worshiper&rsquo;s desire to be purged of sin and sending up the fragrant smoke of true worship to God. The myriad of small details in the execution of the rituals was to teach exactness and precision that would extend to the way the people obeyed the moral and spiritual laws of God and the way they revered every facet of His Word.</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>Leviticus is both a manual for the worship of God in Israel and a theology of Old Covenant ritual. Comprehensive understanding of the ceremonies, laws, and ritual details prescribed in the book is difficult today because Moses assumed a certain context of historical understanding. Once the challenge of understanding the detailed prescriptions has been met, the question arises as to how believers in the church should respond to them, since the NT clearly abrogates OT ceremonial law (cf. Acts 10:1&ndash;16; Col. 2:16, 17), the levitical priesthood (cf. 1 Pet. 2:9; Rev. 1:6; 5:10; 20:6), and the sanctuary (cf. Matt. 27:51), as well as instituting the New Covenant (cf. Matt. 26:28; 2 Cor. 3:6&ndash;18; Heb. 7&ndash;10). Rather than try to practice the old ceremonies or look for some deeper spiritual significance in them, the focus should be on the holy and divine character behind them. This may partly be the reason that explanations which Moses often gave in the prescriptions for cleanness offer greater insight into the mind of God than do the ceremonies themselves. The spiritual principles in which the rituals were rooted are timeless because they are embedded in the nature of God. The NT makes it clear that from Pentecost forward (cf. Acts 2), the church is under the authority of the New Covenant, not the Old (cf. Heb. 7&ndash;10).</p><p>The interpreter is challenged to compare features of this book with NT writers who present types or analogies based on the tabernacle and the ceremonial aspects of the law, so as to teach valuable lessons about Christ and New Covenant reality. Though the ceremonial law served only as a shadow of the reality of Christ and His redemptive work (Heb. 10:1), excessive typology is to be rejected. Only that which NT writers identify as types of Christ should be so designated (cf. 1 Cor. 5:7, &ldquo;Christ our Passover&rdquo;).</p><p>The most profitable study in Leviticus is that which yields truth in the understanding of sin, guilt, substitutionary death, and atonement by focusing on features which are not explained or illustrated elsewhere in OT Scripture. Later OT authors, and especially NT writers, build on the basic understanding of these matters provided in Leviticus. The sacrificial features of Leviticus point to their ultimate, one-time fulfillment in the substitutionary death of Jesus Christ (Heb. 9:11&ndash;22).</p><br /><p>1.

"4","4","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>The English title &ldquo;Numbers&rdquo; comes from the Greek (LXX) and Latin (Vg.) versions.<sup>1</sup> This designation is based on the numberings that are a major focus of chaps. 1&ndash;4 and 26. The most common Hebrew title comes from the fifth word in the Hebrew text of 1:1, &ldquo;in the wilderness [of].&rdquo; This name is much more descriptive of the total contents of the book, which recount the history of Israel during almost 39 years of wandering in the wilderness. Another Hebrew title, favored by some early church Fathers, is based on the first word of the Hebrew text of 1:1, &ldquo;and He spoke.&rdquo; This designation emphasizes that the book records the Word of God to Israel.</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>The first 5 books of the Bible, called the Law, of which Numbers is the fourth, are ascribed to Moses throughout Scripture (Josh. 8:31; 2 Kin. 14:6; Neh. 8:1; Mark 12:26; John 7:19). The book of Numbers itself refers to the writing of Moses in 33:2 and 36:13.</p><p>Numbers was written in the final year of Moses&rsquo; life. The events from 20:1 to the end occur in the 40th year after the Exodus. The account ends with Israel poised on the eastern side of the Jordan River across from Jericho (36:13), which is where the conquest of the land of Canaan began (Josh. 3&ndash;6). The book of Numbers must be dated ca. 1405 B.C., since it is foundational to the book of Deuteronomy, and Deuteronomy is dated in the 11th month of the 40th year after the Exodus (Deut. 1:3).</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>Most of the events of the book are set &ldquo;in the wilderness.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;wilderness&rdquo; is used 48 times in Numbers. This term refers to land that contains little vegetation or trees, and because of a sparsity of rainfall, it cannot be cultivated. This land is best used for tending flocks of animals. In 1:1&ndash;10:10, Israel encamped in &ldquo;the wilderness in Sinai.&rdquo; It was at Sinai that the Lord had entered into the Mosaic Covenant with them (Ex. 19&ndash;24). From 10:11&ndash;12:16, Israel traveled from Sinai to Kadesh. In 13:1&ndash;20:13, the events took place in and around Kadesh, which was located in &ldquo;the wilderness of Paran&rdquo; (12:16; 13:3, 26), &ldquo;the wilderness of Zin&rdquo; (13:21; 20:1). From 20:14&ndash;22:1, Israel traveled from Kadesh to the &ldquo;plains of Moab.&rdquo; All the events of 22:2&ndash;36:13 occurred while Israel was encamped in the plain to the N of Moab. That plain was a flat and fertile piece of land in the middle of the wasteland (21:20; 23:28; 24:1).</p><p>The book of Numbers concentrates on events that take place in the second and fortieth years after the Exodus. All incidents recorded in 1:1&ndash;14:45 occur in 1444 B.C., the year after the Exodus. Everything referred to after 20:1 is dated ca. 1406/1405 B.C., the 40th year after the Exodus. The laws and events found in 15:1&ndash;19:22 are undated, but probably all should be dated ca. 1443 to 1407 B.C. The lack of material devoted to this 37 year period, in comparison with the other years of the journey from Egypt to Canaan, communicates how wasted these years were because of Israel&rsquo;s rebellion against the Lord and His consequent judgment.</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>Numbers chronicles the experiences of two generations of the nation of Israel. The first generation participated in the Exodus from Egypt. Their story begins in Ex. 2:23 and continues through Leviticus and into the first 14 chapters of Numbers. This generation was numbered for the war of conquest in Canaan (1:1&ndash;46). However, when the people arrived at the southern edge of Canaan, they refused to enter the Land (14:1&ndash;10). Because of their rebellion against the Lord, all the adults 20 and over (except Caleb and Joshua) were sentenced to die in the wilderness (14:26&ndash;38). In chaps. 15&ndash;25, the first and second generations overlap; the first died out as the second grew to adulthood. A secondnumbering of the people commenced the history of this second generation (26:1&ndash;56). These Israelites did go to war (26:2) and inherited the land (26:52&ndash;56). The story of this second generation, beginning in Numbers 26:1, continues through the books of Deuteronomy and Joshua.</p><p>Three theological themes permeate Numbers. First, the Lord Himself communicated to Israel through Moses (1:1; 7:89; 12:6&ndash;8), so the words of Moses had divine authority. Israel&rsquo;s response to Moses mirrored her obedience or disobedience to the Lord. Numbers contains three distinct divisions based on Israel&rsquo;s response to the word of the Lord: obedience (chaps. 1&ndash;10), disobedience (chaps. 11&ndash;25), and renewed obedience (chaps. 26&ndash;36). The second theme is that the Lord is the God of judgment. Throughout Numbers, the &ldquo;anger&rdquo; of the Lord was aroused in response to Israel&rsquo;s sin (11:1, 10, 33; 12:9; 14:18; 25:3, 4; 32:10, 13, 14). Third, the faithfulness of the Lord to keep His promise to give the seed of Abraham the land of Canaan is emphasized (15:2; 26:52&ndash;56; 27:12; 33:50&ndash;56; 34:1&ndash;29).</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>Four major interpretive challenges face the reader of Numbers. First, is the book of Numbers a separate book, or is it a part of a larger literary whole, the Pentateuch? The biblical books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy form the Torah. The remainder of the Scripture always views these 5 books as a unit. The ultimate meaning of Numbers cannot be divorced from its context in the Pentateuch. The first verse of the book speaks of the Lord, Moses, the tabernacle and the Exodus from Egypt. This assumes that the reader is familiar with the 3 books that precede Numbers. Still, every Hebrew manuscript available divides the Pentateuch in exactly the same way as the present text. In them the book of Numbers is a well defined unit, with a structural integrity of its own. The book has its own beginning, middle, and ending, even as it functions within a larger whole. Thus, the book of Numbers is also to be viewed with singular identity.</p><p>The second interpretive question asks, &ldquo;Is there a sense of coherence in the book of Numbers?&rdquo; It is readily evident that Numbers contains a wide variety of literary materials and forms. Census lists, genealogies, laws, historical narratives, poetry, prophecy, and travel lists are found in this book. Nevertheless, they are all blended to tell the story of Israel&rsquo;s journey from Mt. Sinai to the Plains of Moab. The coherence of Numbers is reflected in the outline that follows.</p><p>A third issue deals with the large numbers given for the tribes of Israel in 1:46 and 26:51. These two lists of Israel&rsquo;s men of war, taken 39 years apart, both put the number over 600,000. These numbers demand a total population for Israel in the wilderness of around 2.5 million at any one time. From a natural perspective, this total seems too high for the wilderness conditions to sustain. However, it must be recognized that the Lord supernaturally took care of Israel for 40 years (Deut. 8:1&ndash;5). Therefore, the large numbers must be accepted at face value</p><p>The fourth interpretive challenge concerns the heathen prophet Balaam, whose story is recorded in 22:2&ndash;24:25. Even though Balaam claimed to know the Lord (22:18), Scripture consistently refers to him as a false prophet (2 Pet. 2:15, 16, Jude 11). The Lord used Balaam as His mouthpiece to speak the true words He put in his mouth</p><p><br />1. LXX Septuagint&mdash;an ancient translation of the Old Testament into Greek, Vg.

"5","5","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>The English title &ldquo;Deuteronomy&rdquo; comes from the Greek Septuagint (LXX)<sup>1</sup> mistranslation of &ldquo;copy of this law&rdquo; in 17:18 as &ldquo;second law,&rdquo; which was rendered <em>Deuteronomium </em>in the Latin version (Vulgate). The Hebrew title of the book is translated &ldquo;These are the words,&rdquo; from the first two Hebrew words of the book. The Hebrew title is a better description of the book since it is not a &ldquo;second law,&rdquo; but rather the record of Moses&rsquo; words of explanation concerning the law. Deuteronomy completes the five-part literary unit called the Pentateuch.</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>Moses has been traditionally recognized as the author of Deuteronomy, since the book itself testifies that Moses wrote it (1:1, 5; 31:9, 22, 24). Both the OT (1 Kin. 2:3; 8:53; 2 Kin. 14:6; 18:12) and the NT (Acts 3:22, 23; Rom. 10:19) support the claim of Mosaic authorship. While Deut. 32:48&ndash;34:12 was added after Moses&rsquo; death (probably by Joshua), the rest of the book came from Moses&rsquo; hand just before his death in 1405 B.C.</p><p>The majority of the book is comprised of farewell speeches that the 120-year-old Moses gave to Israel, beginning on the first day of the 11th month of the 40th year after the Exodus from Egypt (1:3). These speeches can be dated Jan.&ndash;Feb., 1405 B.C. In the last few weeks of Moses&rsquo; life, he committed these speeches to writing and gave them to the priests and elders for the coming generations of Israel (31:9, 24&ndash;26).</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>Like Leviticus, Deuteronomy does not advance historically, but takes place entirely in one location over about one month of time (cf. Deut. 1:3 and 34:8 with Josh. 5:6&ndash;12). Israel was encamped in the central rift valley to the E of the Jordan River (Deut. 1:1). This location was referred to in Num. 36:13 as &ldquo;the plains of Moab,&rdquo; an area N of the Arnon River across the Jordan River from Jericho. It had been almost 40 years since the Israelites had exited Egypt.</p><p>The book of Deuteronomy concentrates on events that took place in the final weeks of Moses&rsquo; life. The major event was the verbal communication of divine revelation from Moses to the people of Israel (1:1&ndash;30:20; 31:30&ndash;32:47; 33:1&ndash;29). The only other events recorded were: 1) Moses&rsquo; recording the law in a book and his commissioning of Joshua as the new leader (31:1&ndash;29); 2) Moses&rsquo; viewing of the land of Canaan from Mt. Nebo (32:48&ndash;52; 34:1&ndash;4); and 3) his death (34:5&ndash;12).</p><p>The original recipients of Deuteronomy, both in its verbal and written presentations, were the second generation of the nation of Israel. All of that generation from 40 to 60 years of age (except Joshua and Caleb, who were older) had been born in Egypt and had participated as children or teens in the Exodus. Those under 40 had been born and reared in the wilderness. Together, they comprised the generation that was on the verge of conquering the land of Canaan under Joshua, 40 years after they had left Egypt (1:34&ndash;39).</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>Like Leviticus, Deuteronomy contains much legal detail, but with an emphasis on the people rather than the priests. As Moses called the second generation of Israel to trust the Lord and be obedient to His covenant made at Horeb (Sinai), he illustrated his points with references to Israel&rsquo;s past history. He reminded Israel of her rebellion against the Lord at Horeb (9:7&ndash;10:11) and at Kadesh (1:26&ndash;46), which brought devastating consequences. He also reminded her of the Lord&rsquo;s faithfulness in giving victory over her enemies (2:24&ndash;3:11; 29:2, 7, 8). Most importantly, Moses called the people to take the land that God had promised by oath to their forefathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (1:8; 6:10; 9:5; 29:13; 30:20; 34:4; cf. Gen. 15:18&ndash;21; 26:3&ndash;5; 35:12). Moses not only looked back, he also looked ahead and saw that Israel&rsquo;s future failure to obey God would lead to her being scattered among the nations before the fulfillment of His oath to the patriarchs would be completed (4:25&ndash;31; 29:22&ndash;30:10; 31:26&ndash;29).</p><p>The book of Deuteronomy, along with Psalms and Isaiah, reveals much about the attributes of God. Thus, it is directly quoted over 40 times in the NT (exceeded only by Psalms and Isaiah) with many more allusions to its content. Deuteronomy reveals that the Lord is the only God (4:39; 6:4), and that He is jealous (4:24), faithful (7:9), loving (7:13), merciful (4:31), yet angered by sin (6:15). This is the God who called Israel to Himself. Over 250 times, Moses repeated the phrase, &ldquo;the LORDyour God&rdquo; to Israel. Israel was called to obey (28:2), fear (10:12), love (10:12), and serve (10:12) her God by walking in His ways and keeping His commandments (10:12, 13). By obeying Him, the people of Israel would receive His blessings (28:1&ndash;14). Obedience and the pursuit of personal holiness is always based upon the character of God. Because of who He is, His people are to be holy (cf., 7:6&ndash;11; 8:6, 11, 18; 10:12, 16, 17; 11:13; 13:3, 4; 14:1, 2).</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>Three interpretive challenges face the reader of Deuteronomy. First, is the book a singular record, or is it only a part of the larger literary whole, the Pentateuch? The remainder of the Scripture always views the Pentateuch as a unit, and the ultimate meaning of Deuteronomy cannot be divorced from its context in the Pentateuch. The book also assumes the reader is already familiar with the 4 books that precede it; in fact, Deuteronomy brings into focus all that had been revealed in Genesis to Numbers, as well as its implications for the people as they entered the Land. However, every available Hebrew manuscript divides the Pentateuch in exactly the same way as the present text, indicating that the book is a well defined unit recounting the final speeches of Moses to Israel, so it may also be viewed as a singular record.</p><p>Second, is the structure of Deuteronomy based on the secular treaties of Moses&rsquo; day? During the last 35 years, many evangelical scholars have supported the Mosaic authorship of Deuteronomy by appealing to the similarities between the structure of the book and the ancient Near Eastern treaty form of the mid-second millennium B.C. (the approximate time of Moses). These secular suzerainty treaties (i.e., a ruler dictating his will to his vassals) followed a set pattern not used in the mid-first millennium B.C. These treaties usually contained the following elements: 1) preamble&mdash;identifying the parties to the covenant; 2) historical prologue&mdash;a history of the king&rsquo;s dealing with his vassals; 3) general and specific stipulations; 4) witnesses; 5) blessings and curses; and 6) oaths and covenant ratification. Deuteronomy, it is believed, approximates this basic structure. While there is agreement that 1:1&ndash;5 is a preamble, 1:5&ndash;4:43 a historical prologue, and chaps. 27, 28 feature blessings and cursings, there is no consensus as to how the rest of Deuteronomy fits this structure. While there might have been a covenant renewal on the plains of Moab, this is neither clearly explicit nor implicit in Deuteronomy. It is best to take the book for what it claims to be: the explanation of the law given by Moses for the new generation. The structure follows the speeches given by Moses. See Outline.</p><p>Third, what was the covenant made in the land of Moab (29:1)? The majority opinion posits this covenant as a renewal of the Sinaitic Covenant made nearly 40 years before with the first generation. Here, Moses supposedly updated and renewed this same covenant with the second generation of Israel. The second view sees this covenant as a Palestinian Covenant which guarantees the nation of Israel&rsquo;s right to the land, both at that time and in the future. A third position is that Moses in chaps. 29, 30 anticipated the New Covenant, since he knew Israel would fail to keep the Sinaitic Covenant. The third view seems the best.</p><br /><p>1.

"6","6","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>This is the first of the 12 historical books, and it gained its name from the exploits of Joshua, the understudy whom Moses prayed for and commissioned as a leader in Israel (Num. 27:12&ndash;23). &ldquo;Joshua&rdquo; means &ldquo;Jehovah saves,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the LORD is salvation,&rdquo; and corresponds to the NT name &ldquo;Jesus.&rdquo; God delivered Israel in Joshua&rsquo;s day when He was personally present as the saving Commander who fought on Israel&rsquo;s behalf (5:14&ndash;6:2; 10:42; 23:3, 5; Acts 7:45).</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>Although the author is not named, the most probable candidate is Joshua, who was the key eyewitness to the events recorded (cf. 18:9; 24:26).

Some have even suggested that this section was written by the High-Priest Eleazar, or his son, Phinehas. Rahab was still living at the time Josh. 6:25 was penned. The book was completed before David&rsquo;s reign (15:63; cf. 2 Sam. 5:5&ndash;9). The most likely writing period is ca. 1405&ndash;1385 B.C.</p><p>Joshua was born in Egyptian slavery, trained under Moses, and by God&rsquo;s choice rose to his key position of leading Israel into Canaan. distinguishing features of his life include: 1) service (Ex. 17:10; 24:13; 33:11; Num. 11:28); 2) soldiering (Ex. 17:9&ndash;13); 3) scouting (Num. 13, 14); 4) supplication by Moses (Num. 27:15&ndash;17); 5) the sovereignty of God (Num 27:18ff.); 6) the Spirit&rsquo;s presence (Num. 27:18; Deut. 34:9); 7) separation by Moses (Num. 27:18&ndash;23; Deut. 31:7, 8, 13&ndash;15); and 8) selflessness in wholly following the Lord (Num. 32:12).</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>When Moses passed the baton of leadership on to Joshua before he died (Deut. 34), Israel was at the end of its 40 year wilderness wandering period ca. 1405 B.C. Joshua was approaching 90 years of age when he became Israel&rsquo;s leader. He later died at the age of 110 (24:29), having led Israel to drive out most of the Canaanites and having divided the Land among the 12 tribes. Poised on the plains of Moab, E of the Jordan River and the Land which God had promised (Gen. 12:7; 15:18&ndash;21), the Israelites awaited God&rsquo;s direction to conquer the Land. They faced peoples on the western side of the Jordan who had become so steeped in iniquity that God would cause the Land, so to speak, to spew out these inhabitants (Lev.18:24, 25). He would give Israel the Land by conquest, primarily to fulfill the covenant He had pledged to Abraham and his descendants, but also to pass just judgment on the sinful inhabitants (cf. Gen. 15:16). Long possession of different parts of the Land by various peoples had pre-dated even Abraham&rsquo;s day (Gen. 10:15&ndash;19; 12:6; 13:7). Its inhabitants had continued on a moral decline in the worship of many gods up to Joshua&rsquo;s time.</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>A keynote feature is God&rsquo;s faithfulness to fulfill His promise of giving the Land to Abraham&rsquo;s descendants (Gen. 12:7; 15:18&ndash;21; 17:8). By His leading (cf. 5:14&ndash;6:2), they inhabited the territories E and W of the Jordan, and so the word &ldquo;possess&rdquo; appears nearly 20 times.</p><p>Related to this theme is Israel&rsquo;s failure to press their conquest to every part of the Land (13:1). Judges 1&ndash;2 later describes the tragic results from this sin. Key verses focus on: 1) God&rsquo;s promise of possession of the Land (1:3, 6); 2) meditation on God&rsquo;s law, which was strategic for His people (1:8); and 3) Israel&rsquo;s actual possession of the Land in part (11:23; 21:45; 22:4).</p><p>Specific allotment of distinct portions in the Land was Joshua&rsquo;s task, as recorded in chaps. 13&ndash;22. Levites were placed strategically in 48 towns so that God&rsquo;s spiritual services through them would be reasonably within reach of the Israelites, wherever they lived.</p><p>God wanted His people to possess the Land: 1) to keep His promise (Gen. 12:7); 2) to set the stage for later developments in His kingdom plan (cf. Gen. 17:8; 49:8&ndash;12), e.g., positioning Israel for events in the periods of the kings and prophets; 3) to punish peoples that were an affront to Him because of extreme sinfulness (Lev. 18:25); and 4) to be a testimony to other peoples (Josh. 2:9&ndash;11), as God&rsquo;s covenant heart reached out to all nations (Gen. 12:1&ndash;3).</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>Miracles always challenge readers either to believe that the God who created heaven and earth (Gen. 1:1) can do other mighty works, too, or to explain them away. As in Moses&rsquo; day, miracles in this book were a part of God&rsquo;s purpose, such as: 1) His holding back the Jordan&rsquo;s waters (Josh. 3:7&ndash;17); 2) the fall of Jericho&rsquo;s walls (Josh. 6:1&ndash;27); 3) the hailstones (Josh. 10:1&ndash;11); and 4) the long day (Josh. 10:12&ndash;15).</p><p>Other challenges include: 1) How did God&rsquo;s blessing on the harlot Rahab, who responded to Him in faith, relate to her telling a lie (Josh. 2)? 2) Why were Achan&rsquo;s family members executed with him (Josh. 7)? 3) Why was Ai, with fewer men than Israel, hard to conquer (Josh. 7&ndash;8)? 4) What does God&rsquo;s &ldquo;sending the hornet&rdquo; before Israel mean (Josh. 24:12)? These questions will be addressed in the notes.</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I. Entering the Promised Land (1:1&ndash;5:15)</strong></p><p><strong>II.

"7","7","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><br /><p>The book bears the fitting name &ldquo;Judges,&rdquo; which refers to unique leaders God gave to His people for preservation against their enemies (2:16&ndash;19). The Hebrew title means &ldquo;deliverers&rdquo; or &ldquo;saviors,&rdquo; as well as judges (cf. Deut. 16:18; 17:9; 19:17). Twelve such judges arose before Samuel; then Eli and Samuel raised the count to 14. God Himself is the higher Judge (11:27). Judges spans about 350 years from Joshua&rsquo;s conquest (ca. 1398 B.C.) until Eli and Samuel judged prior to the establishment of the monarchy (ca. 1043B.C.).</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>No author is named in the book, but the Jewish Talmud identifies Samuel, a key prophet who lived at the time these events took place and could have personally summed up the era (cf. 1 Sam. 10:25). The time was earlier than David&rsquo;s capture of Jerusalem ca. 1004 B.C. (2 Sam. 5:6, 7) since Jebusites still controlled the site (Judg. 1:21). Also, the writer deals with a time before a king ruled (17:6; 18:1; 21:25). Since Saul began his reign ca. 1043 B.C., a time shortly after his rule began is probably when Judges was written.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>Judges is a tragic sequel to Joshua. In Joshua, the people were obedient to God in conquering the Land. In Judges, they were disobedient, idolatrous, and often defeated. Judges 1:1&ndash;3:6 focuses on the closing days of the book of Joshua. Judges 2:6&ndash;9 gives a review of Joshua&rsquo;s death (cf. Josh. 24:28&ndash;31). The account describes 7 distinct cycles of Israel&rsquo;s drifting away from the Lord starting even before Joshua&rsquo;s death, with a full departure into apostasy afterward. Five basic reasons are evident for these cycles of Israel&rsquo;s moral and spiritual decline: 1) disobedience in failing to drive the Canaanites out of the Land (Judg. 1:19, 21, 35); 2) idolatry (2:12); 3) intermarriage with wicked Canaanites (3:5, 6); 4) not heeding judges (2:17); and 5) turning away from God after the death of the judges (2:19).</p><p>A four-part sequence repeatedly occurred in this phase of Israel&rsquo;s history: 1) Israel&rsquo;s departure from God; 2) God&rsquo;s chastisement in permitting military defeat and subjugation; 3) Israel&rsquo;s prayer pleading for deliverance; and 4) God raising up &ldquo;judges,&rdquo; either civil or sometimes local military champions who led in shaking off the oppressors. Fourteen judges arose, six of them military judges (Othniel, Ehud, Deborah, Gideon, Jephthah, and Samson). Two men were of special significance for contrast in spiritual leadership: 1) Eli, judge and High-Priest (not a good example); and 2) Samuel, judge, priest, and prophet (a good example).</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>Judges is thematic rather than chronological; foremost among its themes is God&rsquo;s power and covenant mercy in graciously delivering the Israelites from the consequences of their failures, which were suffered for sinful compromise (cf. 2:18, 19; 21:25). In 7 periods of sin to salvation (cf. Introduction: Outline), God compassionately delivered His people throughout the different geographical areas of tribal inheritances which He had earlier given through Joshua (Josh. 13&ndash;22). The apostasy covered the whole land, as indicated by the fact that each area is specifically identified: southern (3:7&ndash;31); northern (4:1&ndash;5:31); central (6:1&ndash;10:5); eastern (10:6&ndash;12:15); and western (13:1&ndash;16:31). His power to faithfully rescue shines against the dark backdrop of pitiful human compromise and sometimes bizarre twists of sin, as in the final summary (Judg. 17&ndash;21). The last verse (21:25) sums up the account: &ldquo;In those days <em>there was</em> no king in Israel; everyone did <em>what was</em> right in his own eyes.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>The most stimulating challenges are: 1) how to view men&rsquo;s violent acts against enemies or fellow countrymen, whether with God&rsquo;s approval or without it; 2) God&rsquo;s use of leaders who at times do His will and at times follow their own sinful impulse (Gideon, Eli, Jephthah, Samson); 3) how to view Jephthah&rsquo;s vow and offering of his daughter (11:30&ndash;40); and 4) how to resolve God&rsquo;s sovereign will with His providential working in spite of human sin (cf. 14:4).</p><p>The chronology of the various judges in different sectors of the Land raises questions about how much time passed and how the time totals can fit into the entire time span from the Exodus (ca. 1445B.C.) to Solomon&rsquo;s fourth year, ca. 967/966 B.C., which is said to be 480 years (1 Kin. 6:1; see Judg. 11:26 and note). A reasonable explanation is that the deliverances and years of rest under the judges in distinct parts of the Land included overlaps, so that some of them did not run consecutively but rather concurrently during the 480 years. Paul&rsquo;s estimate of &ldquo;about 450&rdquo; years in Acts 13:20 is an approximation.</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I.

"8","8","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>Ancient versions and modern translations consistently entitle this book after Ruth the Moabitess heroine, who is mentioned by name twelve times (1:4 to 4:13). Only two OT books receive their names from women&mdash;Ruth and Esther. The OT does not again refer to Ruth, while the NT mentions her just once&mdash;in the context of Christ&rsquo;s genealogy (Matt. 1:5; cf. 4:18&ndash;22). &ldquo;Ruth&rdquo; most likely comes from a Moabite and/or Hebrew word meaning &ldquo;friendship.&rdquo;Ruth arrived in Bethlehem as a foreigner (2:10), became a maidservant (2:13), married wealthy Boaz (4:13), and discovered herself in the physical lineage of Christ (Matt. 1:5).</p><p><strong><img style=""float: left; margin-left: 6px; margin-right: 6px; border-width: 0px;"" src=""http://www.gty.org/media/images/RuthMap.png"" alt=""Moab to Bethlehem"" width=""339"" height=""408"" />Author and Date</strong></p><p>Jewish tradition credits Samuel as the author, which is plausible since he did not die (1 Sam. 25:1) until after he had anointed David as God&rsquo;s chosen king (1 Sam. 16:6&ndash;13). However, neither internal features nor external testimony conclusively identifies the writer. This exquisite story most likely appeared shortly before or during David&rsquo;s reign of Israel (1011&ndash;971 B.C.) since David is mentioned (4:17, 22) but not Solomon. Goethe reportedly labeled this piece of anonymous but unexcelled literature as &ldquo;the loveliest, complete work on a small scale.&rdquo; What Venus is to statuary and the Mona Lisa is to paintings, Ruth is to literature.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>Aside from Bethlehem (1:1), Moab (the perennial enemy of Israel which was east of the Dead Sea), stands as the only other mentioned geographic/national entity (1:1, 2). This country originated when Lot fathered Moab by an incestuous union with his oldest daughter (Gen. 19:37). Centuries later the Jews encountered opposition from Balak, king of Moab, through the prophet Balaam (Num. 22&ndash;25). For 18 years Moab oppressed Israel during the judges (3:12&ndash;30). Saul defeated the Moabites (1 Sam. 14:47) while David seemed to enjoy a peaceful relationship with them (1 Sam. 22:3, 4). Later, Moab again troubled Israel (2 Kin. 3:5&ndash;27; Ezra 9:1). Because of Moab&rsquo;s idolatrous worship of Chemosh (1 Kin. 11:7, 33; 2 Kin. 23:13) and its opposition to Israel, God cursed Moab (Is. 15&ndash;16; Jer. 48; Ezek. 25:8&ndash;11; Amos 2:1&ndash;3).</p><p>The story of Ruth occurred in the days &ldquo;when the judges ruled&rdquo; Israel (1:1) ca. 1370 to 1041B.C. (Judg. 2:16&ndash;19) and thus bridges time from the judges to Israel&rsquo;s monarchy. God used &ldquo;a famine in the land&rdquo; of Judah (1:1) to set in motion this beautiful drama, although the famine does not receive mention in Judges which causes difficulty in dating the events of Ruth. However, by working backward in time from the well known date of David&rsquo;s reign (1011&ndash;971 B.C.), the time period of Ruth would most likely be during the judgeship of Jair, ca. 1126&ndash;1105 B.C. (Judg. 10:3&ndash;5).</p><p>Ruth covers about 11&ndash;12 years according to the following scenario: 1) 1:1&ndash;18, ten years in Moab (1:4); 2) 1:19&ndash;2:23, several months (mid-Apr. to mid-June) in Boaz&rsquo;s field (1:22; 2:23); 3) 3:1&ndash;18, one day in Bethlehem and one night at the threshing floor; and 4) 4:1&ndash;22, about one year in Bethlehem.</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>All 85 verses of Ruth have been accepted as canonical by the Jews. Along with Song of Solomon, Esther, Ecclesiastes, and Lamentations, Ruth stands with the OT books of the Megilloth or &ldquo;five scrolls.&rdquo; Rabbis read these books in the synagogue on five special occasions during the year&mdash;Ruth being read at Pentecost due to the harvest scenes of Ruth 2&ndash;3.</p><p>Genealogically, Ruth looks back almost 900 years to events in the time of Jacob (4:11) and forward about 100 years to the coming reign of David (4:17, 22). While Joshua and Judges emphasize the legacy of the nation and their land of promise, Ruth focuses on the lineage of David back to the Patriarchal era.</p><p>At least seven major theological themes emerge in Ruth. First, Ruth the Moabitess illustrates that God&rsquo;s redemptive plan extended beyond the Jews to Gentiles (2:12). Second, Ruth demonstrates that women are co-heirs with men of God&rsquo;s salvation grace (cf. 1 Pet. 3:7). Third, Ruth portrays the virtuous woman of Proverbs 31:10 (cf. 3:11). Fourth, Ruth describes God&rsquo;s sovereign (1:6; 4:13) and providential care (2:3) of seemingly unimportant people at apparently insignificant times which later prove to be monumentally crucial to accomplishing God&rsquo;s will. Fifth, Ruth along with Tamar (Gen. 38), Rahab (Josh. 2) and Bathsheba (2 Sam. 11&ndash;12) stand in the genealogy of the Messianic line (4:17, 22; cf. Matt. 1:5). Sixth, Boaz, as a type of Christ, becomes Ruth&rsquo;s kinsman-redeemer (4:1&ndash;12). Finally, David&rsquo;s right (and thus Christ&rsquo;s right) to the throne of Israel is traced back to Judah (4:18&ndash;22; cf. Gen. 49:8&ndash;12).</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>Ruth should be understood as a true historical account. The reliable facts surrounding Ruth, in addition to its complete compatibility with Judges plus 1 and 2 Samuel, confirm Ruth&rsquo;s authenticity. However, some individual difficulties require careful attention. First, how could Ruth worship at the tabernacle then in Shiloh (1 Sam. 4:4), since Deuteronomy 23:3 expressly forbids Moabites from entering the assembly for ten generations? Since the Jews entered the land ca. 1405B.C. and Ruth was not born until ca. 1150 B.C., she then represented at least the eleventh generation (probably later) if the time limitation ended at ten generations. If &ldquo;ten generations&rdquo; was an idiom meaning &ldquo;forever&rdquo; as ehemiah 13:1 implies, then Ruth would be like the foreigner of Isaiah 56:1&ndash;8 who joined himself to the LORD (1:16) thus gaining entrance to the assembly.</p><p>Second, are there not immoral overtones to Boaz and Ruth spending the night together before marriage (3:3&ndash;18)? Ruth engaged in a common ancient Near Eastern custom by asking Boaz to take her for his wife as symbolically pictured by throwing a garment over the intended woman (3:9), just as Jehovah spread His garment over Israel (Ezek. 16:8). The text does not even hint at the slightest moral impropriety, noting that Ruth slept at his feet (3:14). Thus, Boaz became God&rsquo;s answer to his own earlier prayer for Ruth (2:12).</p><p>Third, would not the levirate principle of Deuteronomy 25:5, 6 lead to incest and/or polygamy if the nearest relative was already married? God would not design a good plan to involve the grossest of immoralities punishable by death. It is to be assumed that the implementation of Deuteronomy 25:5, 6 could involve only the nearest relative who was eligible for marriage as qualified by other stipulations of the law.</p><br /><p>Fourth, was not marriage to a Moabitess strictly forbidden by the law? The nations or people to whom marriage was prohibited were those possessing the land that Israel would enter (Ex. 34:16; Deut. 7:1&ndash;3; Josh. 23:12) which did not include Moab (cf. Deut. 7:1). Further, Boaz married Ruth, a devout proselyte to Jehovah (1:16&ndash;17) not a pagan worshiper of Chemosh&mdash;Moab&rsquo;s chief deity (cf. later problems in Ezra 9:1, 2 and Neh. 13:23&ndash;25).<strong></strong></p><br /><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I.

"9","9","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>First and Second Samuel were considered as one book in the earliest Hebrew manuscript, and were later divided into the two books by the translators of the Greek version, the Septuagint (LXX), a division followed by the Latin Vulgate (Vg.), English translations, and modern Hebrew Bibles. The earliest Hebrew manuscripts entitled the one book &ldquo;Samuel&rdquo; after the man God used to establish the kingship in Israel. Later Hebrew texts and the English versions call the divided book &ldquo;1 and 2 Samuel.&rdquo; The LXX designated them &ldquo;The First and Second Books of Kingdoms&rdquo; and the Vg., &ldquo;First and Second Kings,&rdquo; with our 1 and 2 Kings being &ldquo;Third and Fourth Kings.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>Jewish tradition ascribed the writing of &ldquo;Samuel&rdquo; to Samuel himself or to Samuel, Nathan, and Gad (based on 1 Chr. 29:29). But Samuel cannot be the writer because his death is recorded in 1 Sam. 25:1, before the events associated with David&rsquo;s reign even took place. Further, Nathan and Gad were prophets of the Lord during David&rsquo;s lifetime and would not have been alive when the book of Samuel was written. Though the written records of these 3 prophets could have been used for information in the writing of 1 and 2 Samuel, the human author of these books is unknown. The work comes to the reader as an anonymous writing, i.e., the human author speaks for the Lord and gives the divine interpretation of the events narrated.</p><p>The books of Samuel contain no clear indication of the date of composition. That the author wrote after the division of the kingdom between Israel and Judah in 931 B.C. is clear, due to the many references to Israel and Judah as distinct entities (1 Sam. 11:8; 17:52; 18:16; 2 Sam. 5:5; 11:11; 12:8; 19:42&ndash;43; 24:1, 9). Also, the statement concerning Ziklag&rsquo;s belonging &ldquo;to the kings of Judah to this day&rdquo; in 1 Sam. 27:6 gives clear evidence of a post-Solomonic date of writing. There is no such clarity concerning how late the date of writing could be. However, 1 and 2 Samuel are included in the Former Prophets in the Hebrew canon, along with Joshua, Judges, and 1 and 2 Kings. If the Former Prophets were composed as a unit, then Samuel would have been written during the Babylonian captivity (ca. 560&ndash;540 B.C.), since 2 Kings concludes during the exile (2 Kin. 25:27&ndash;30). However, since Samuel has a different literary style than Kings, it was most likely penned before the Exile during the period of the divided kingdom (ca. 931&ndash;722B.C.) and later made an integral part of the Former Prophets.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>The majority of the action recorded in 1 and 2 Samuel took place in and around the central highlands in the land of Israel. The nation of Israel was largely concentrated in an area that ran about 90 mi. from the hill country of Ephraim in the N (1 Sam. 1:1; 9:4) to the hill country of Judah in the S (Josh. 20:7; 21:11) and between 15 to 35 mi. E to W. This central spine ranges in height from 1,500 ft. to 3,300 ft. above sea level. The major cities of 1 and 2 Samuel are to be found in these central highlands: Shiloh, the residence of Eli and the tabernacle; Ramah, the hometown of Samuel; Gibeah, the headquarters of Saul; Bethlehem, the birthplace of David; Hebron, David&rsquo;s capital when he ruled over Judah; and Jerusalem, the ultimate &ldquo;city of David.&rdquo;</p><p>The events of 1 and 2 Samuel took place between the years ca. 1105 B.C., the birth of Samuel (1 Sam. 1:1&ndash;28), to ca. 971 B.C., the last words of David (2 Sam. 23:1&ndash;7). Thus, the books span about 135 years of history. During those years, Israel was transformed from a loosely knit group of tribes under &ldquo;judges&rdquo; to a united nation under the reign of a centralized monarchy. They look primarily at Samuel (ca. 1105&ndash;1030 B.C.), Saul who reigned ca. 1052&ndash;1011 B.C., and David who was king of the united monarchy ca. 1011&ndash;971B.C.</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>As 1 Samuel begins, Israel was at a low point spiritually. The priesthood was corrupt (1 Sam. 2:12&ndash;17, 22&ndash;26), the ark of the covenant was not at the tabernacle (1 Sam. 4:3&ndash;7:2), idolatry was practiced (1 Sam. 7:3, 4), and the judges were dishonest (1 Sam. 8:2, 3). Through the influence of godly Samuel (1 Sam. 12:23) and David (1 Sam. 13:14), these conditions were reversed. Second Samuel concludes with the anger of the Lord being withdrawn from Israel (2 Sam. 24:25).</p><p>During the years narrated in 1 and 2 Samuel, the great empires of the ancient world were in a state of weakness. Neither Egypt nor the Mesopotamian powers, Babylon and Assyria, were threats to Israel at that time. The two nations most hostile to the Israelites were the Philistines (1 Sam. 4; 7; 13, 14; 17; 23; 31; 2 Sam. 5) to the W and the Ammonites (1 Sam. 11; 2 Sam. 10&ndash;12) to the E. The major contingent of the Philistines had migrated from the Aegean Islands and Asia Minor in the 12th century B.C. After being denied access to Egypt, they settled among other preexisting Philistines along the Mediterranean coast of Palestine. The Philistines controlled the use of iron, which gave them a decided military and economic advantage over Israel (1 Sam. 13:19&ndash;22). The Ammonites were descendants of Lot (Gen. 19:38) who lived on the Transjordan Plateau. David conquered the Philistines (2 Sam. 8:1) and mi. mile/miles the Ammonites (2 Sam. 12:29&ndash;31), along with other nations that surrounded Israel (2 Sam. 8:2&ndash;14).</p><p>There are four predominant theological themes in 1 and 2 Samuel. The first is the Davidic Covenant. The books are literarily framed by two references to the &ldquo;anointed&rdquo; king in the prayer of Hannah (1 Sam. 2:10) and the song of David (2 Sam. 22:51). This is a reference to the Messiah, the King who will triumph over the nations who are opposed to God (see Gen. 49:8&ndash;12; Num. 24:7&ndash;9, 17&ndash;19). According to the Lord&rsquo;s promise, this Messiah will come through the line of David and establish David&rsquo;s throne forever (2 Sam. 7:12&ndash;16). The events of David&rsquo;s life recorded in Samuel foreshadow the actions of David&rsquo;s greater Son (i.e., Christ) in the future.</p><p>A second theme is the sovereignty of God, clearly seen in these books. One example is the birth of Samuel in response to Hannah&rsquo;s prayer (1 Sam. 9:17; 16:12, 13). Also, in relation to David, it is particularly evident that nothing can frustrate God&rsquo;s plan to have him rule over Israel (1 Sam. 24:20).</p><p>Third, the work of the Holy Spirit in empowering men for divinely appointed tasks is evident. The Spirit of the Lord came upon both Saul and David after their anointing as king (1 Sam. 10:10; 16:13). The power of the Holy Spirit brought forth prophecy (1 Sam. 10:6) and victory in battle (1 Sam. 11:6).</p><p>Fourth, the books of Samuel demonstrate the personal and national effects of sin. The sins of Eli and his sons resulted in their deaths (1 Sam. 2:12&ndash;17, 22&ndash;25; 3:10&ndash;14; 4:17, 18). The lack of reverence for the ark of the covenant led to the death of a number of Israelites (1 Sam. 6:19; 2 Sam. 6:6, 7). Saul&rsquo;s disobedience resulted in the Lord&rsquo;s judgment, and he was rejected as king over Israel (1 Sam. 13:9, 13, 14; 15:8, 9, 20&ndash;23). Although David was forgiven for his sin of adultery and murder after his confession (2 Sam. 12:13), he still suffered the inevitable and devastating consequences of his sin (2 Sam. 12:14).</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>The books of Samuel contain a number of interpretive issues that have been widely discussed:</p><p>1) Which of the ancient mss. is closest to the original autograph? The standard Hebrew (Masoretic) text has been relatively poorly preserved, and the LXX often differs from it. Thus, the exact reading of the original autograph of the text is in places hard to determine (see 1 Sam. 13:1). The NKJV uses the Masoretic text with significant variant readings in the marginal notes. The Masoretic text will be assumed to represent the original text unless there is a grammatical or contextual impossibility. This accounts for many of the numerical discrepancies.</p><p>2) Is Samuel ambivalent to the establishment of the human kingship in Israel? It is claimed that while 1 Sam. 9&ndash;11 presents a positive view of the kingship, 1 Sam. 8 and 12 are strongly anti-monarchial. It is preferable, however, to see the book as presenting a balanced perspective of the human kingship. While the desire of Israel for a king was acceptable (Deut. 17:15), their reason for wanting a king showed a lack of faith in the Lord.</p><p>3) How does one explain the bizarre behavior of the prophets? It is commonly held that 1 and 2 Samuel present the prophets as ecstatic speakers with bizarre behavior just likethe pagan prophets of the other nations. But there is nothing in the text which is inconsistent with seeing the prophets as communicators of divine revelation, at times prophesying with musical accompaniment.</p><p>4) How did the Holy Spirit minister before Pentecost? The ministry of the Holy Spirit in 1 Sam. 10:6, 10; 11:16; 16:13, 14; 19:20, 23; 2 Sam. 23:2 was not describing salvation in the NT sense, but an empowering by the Lord for His service (see also Judg. 3:10; 6:34; 11:29; 13:25; 14:6, 19; 15:14).</p><p>5) What was the identity of the &ldquo;distressing spirit from the Lord&rdquo;? Is it a personal being, i.e., a demon, or a spirit of discontent created by God in the heart (cf. Judg. 9:23)? Traditionally, it has been viewed as a demon.</p><p>6) How did Samuel appear in 1 Sam. 28:3-5? It seems best to understand the appearance of Samuel as the Lord allowing the dead Samuel to speak with Saul.</p><p>7) What is the identity of David&rsquo;s seed in 2 Sam. 7:12&ndash;15? It is usually taken as Solomon. However, the NT refers the words to Jesus, God&rsquo;s Son in Heb. 1:5.</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I.

"10","10","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>First and Second Samuel were considered as one book in the earliest Hebrew manuscript, and were later divided into the two books by the translators of the Greek version, the Septuagint (LXX), a division followed by the Latin Vulgate (Vg.), English translations, and modern Hebrew Bibles. The earliest Hebrew manuscripts entitled the one book &ldquo;Samuel&rdquo; after the man God used to establish the kingship in Israel. Later Hebrew texts and the English versions call the divided book &ldquo;1 and 2 Samuel.&rdquo; The LXX designated them &ldquo;The First and Second Books of Kingdoms&rdquo; and the Vg., &ldquo;First and Second Kings,&rdquo; with our 1 and 2 Kings being &ldquo;Third and Fourth Kings.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>Jewish tradition ascribed the writing of &ldquo;Samuel&rdquo; to Samuel himself or to Samuel, Nathan, and Gad (based on 1 Chr. 29:29). But Samuel cannot be the writer because his death is recorded in 1 Sam. 25:1, before the events associated with David&rsquo;s reign even took place. Further, Nathan and Gad were prophets of the Lord during David&rsquo;s lifetime and would not have been alive when the book of Samuel was written. Though the written records of these 3 prophets could have been used for information in the writing of 1 and 2 Samuel, the human author of these books is unknown. The work comes to the reader as an anonymous writing, i.e., the human author speaks for the Lord and gives the divine interpretation of the events narrated.</p><p>The books of Samuel contain no clear indication of the date of composition. That the author wrote after the division of the kingdom between Israel and Judah in 931 B.C. is clear, due to the many references to Israel and Judah as distinct entities (1 Sam. 11:8; 17:52; 18:16; 2 Sam. 5:5; 11:11; 12:8; 19:42&ndash;43; 24:1, 9). Also, the statement concerning Ziklag&rsquo;s belonging &ldquo;to the kings of Judah to this day&rdquo; in 1 Sam. 27:6 gives clear evidence of a post-Solomonic date of writing. There is no such clarity concerning how late the date of writing could be. However, 1 and 2 Samuel are included in the Former Prophets in the Hebrew canon, along with Joshua, Judges, and 1 and 2 Kings. If the Former Prophets were composed as a unit, then Samuel would have been written during the Babylonian captivity (ca. 560&ndash;540 B.C.), since 2 Kings concludes during the exile (2 Kin. 25:27&ndash;30). However, since Samuel has a different literary style than Kings, it was most likely penned before the Exile during the period of the divided kingdom (ca. 931&ndash;722B.C.) and later made an integral part of the Former Prophets.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>The majority of the action recorded in 1 and 2 Samuel took place in and around the central highlands in the land of Israel. The nation of Israel was largely concentrated in an area that ran about 90 mi. from the hill country of Ephraim in the N (1 Sam. 1:1; 9:4) to the hill country of Judah in the S (Josh. 20:7; 21:11) and between 15 to 35 mi. E to W. This central spine ranges in height from 1,500 ft. to 3,300 ft. above sea level. The major cities of 1 and 2 Samuel are to be found in these central highlands: Shiloh, the residence of Eli and the tabernacle; Ramah, the hometown of Samuel; Gibeah, the headquarters of Saul; Bethlehem, the birthplace of David; Hebron, David&rsquo;s capital when he ruled over Judah; and Jerusalem, the ultimate &ldquo;city of David.&rdquo;</p><p>The events of 1 and 2 Samuel took place between the years ca. 1105 B.C., the birth of Samuel (1 Sam. 1:1&ndash;28), to ca. 971 B.C., the last words of David (2 Sam. 23:1&ndash;7). Thus, the books span about 135 years of history. During those years, Israel was transformed from a loosely knit group of tribes under &ldquo;judges&rdquo; to a united nation under the reign of a centralized monarchy. They look primarily at Samuel (ca. 1105&ndash;1030 B.C.), Saul who reigned ca. 1052&ndash;1011 B.C., and David who was king of the united monarchy ca. 1011&ndash;971B.C.</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>As 1 Samuel begins, Israel was at a low point spiritually. The priesthood was corrupt (1 Sam. 2:12&ndash;17, 22&ndash;26), the ark of the covenant was not at the tabernacle (1 Sam. 4:3&ndash;7:2), idolatry was practiced (1 Sam. 7:3, 4), and the judges were dishonest (1 Sam. 8:2, 3). Through the influence of godly Samuel (1 Sam. 12:23) and David (1 Sam. 13:14), these conditions were reversed. Second Samuel concludes with the anger of the Lord being withdrawn from Israel (2 Sam. 24:25).</p><p>During the years narrated in 1 and 2 Samuel, the great empires of the ancient world were in a state of weakness. Neither Egypt nor the Mesopotamian powers, Babylon and Assyria, were threats to Israel at that time. The two nations most hostile to the Israelites were the Philistines (1 Sam. 4; 7; 13, 14; 17; 23; 31; 2 Sam. 5) to the W and the Ammonites (1 Sam. 11; 2 Sam. 10&ndash;12) to the E. The major contingent of the Philistines had migrated from the Aegean Islands and Asia Minor in the 12th century B.C. After being denied access to Egypt, they settled among other preexisting Philistines along the Mediterranean coast of Palestine. The Philistines controlled the use of iron, which gave them a decided military and economic advantage over Israel (1 Sam. 13:19&ndash;22). The Ammonites were descendants of Lot (Gen. 19:38) who lived on the Transjordan Plateau. David conquered the Philistines (2 Sam. 8:1) and mi. mile/miles the Ammonites (2 Sam. 12:29&ndash;31), along with other nations that surrounded Israel (2 Sam. 8:2&ndash;14).</p><p>There are four predominant theological themes in 1 and 2 Samuel. The first is the Davidic Covenant. The books are literarily framed by two references to the &ldquo;anointed&rdquo; king in the prayer of Hannah (1 Sam. 2:10) and the song of David (2 Sam. 22:51). This is a reference to the Messiah, the King who will triumph over the nations who are opposed to God (see Gen. 49:8&ndash;12; Num. 24:7&ndash;9, 17&ndash;19). According to the Lord&rsquo;s promise, this Messiah will come through the line of David and establish David&rsquo;s throne forever (2 Sam. 7:12&ndash;16). The events of David&rsquo;s life recorded in Samuel foreshadow the actions of David&rsquo;s greater Son (i.e., Christ) in the future.</p><p>A second theme is the sovereignty of God, clearly seen in these books. One example is the birth of Samuel in response to Hannah&rsquo;s prayer (1 Sam. 9:17; 16:12, 13).

"11","11","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>First and Second Kings were originally one book, called in the Hebrew text, &ldquo;Kings,&rdquo; from the first word in 1:1. The Greek translation of the OT, the Septuagint (LXX), divided the book in two, and this was followed by the Latin Vulgate (Vg.) version and English translations. The division was for the convenience of copying this lengthy book on scrolls and codexes and was not based on features of content. Modern Hebrew Bibles title the books &ldquo;Kings A&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kings B.&rdquo; The LXX and Vg. connected Kings with the books of Samuel, so that the titles in the LXX are &ldquo;The Third and Fourth Books of Kingdoms&rdquo; and in the Vg. &ldquo;Third and Fourth Kings.&rdquo; The books of 1 and 2 Samuel and 1 and 2 Kings combined are a chronicle of the entire history of Judah&rsquo;s and Israel&rsquo;s kingship from Saul to Zedekiah. First and Second Chronicles provides only the history of Judah&rsquo;s monarchy.</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>Jewish tradition proposed that Jeremiah wrote Kings, though this is unlikely because the final event recorded in the book (see 2 Kin. 25:27&ndash;30) occurred in Babylon in 561 B.C. Jeremiah never went to Babylon, but to Egypt (Jer. 43:1&ndash;7), and would have been at least 86 years old by 561 B.C. Actually, the identity of the unnamed author remains unknown. Since the ministry of prophets is emphasized in Kings, it seems that the author was most likely an unnamed prophet of the Lord who lived in exile with Israel in Babylon.</p><p>Kings was written between 561&ndash;538 B.C. Since the last narrated event (2 Kin. 25:27&ndash;30) sets the earliest possible date of completion and because there is no record of the end of the Babylonian captivity in Kings, the release from exile (538 B.C.) identifies the latest possible writing date. This date is sometimes challenged on the basis of &ldquo;to this day&rdquo; statements in 1 Kin. 8:8; 9:13, 20, 21; 10:12; 12:19; 2 Kin. 2:22; 8:22; 10:27; 14:7; 16:6; 17:23, 34, 41; 21:15. However, it is best to understand these statements as those of the sources used by the<br />author, rather than statements of the author himself.<br /><br />It is clear that the author used a variety of sources in compiling this book, including &ldquo;the book of the acts of Solomon&rdquo; (1 Kin. 11:41), &ldquo;the chronicles of the kings of Israel&rdquo; (1 Kin. 14:19; 15:31; 16:5, 14, 20, 27; 22:39; 2 Kin. 1:18; 10:34; 13:8, 12; 14:15, 28; 15:11, 15, 21, 26, 31), and &ldquo;the chronicles of the kings of Judah&rdquo; (1 Kin. 14:29; 15:7, 23; 22:45; 2 Kin. 8:23; 12:19; 14:18; 15:6, 36; 16:19; 20:20; 21:17, 25; 23:28; 24:5). Further, Is. 36:1&ndash;39:8 provided information used in 2 Kin. 18:9&ndash;20:19, and Jer. 52:31&ndash;34 seems to be the source for 2 Kin. 25:27&ndash;29. This explanation posits a single inspired author, living in Babylon during the Exile, using these pre-Exilic source materials at his disposal.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>A distinction must be made between the setting of the books&rsquo; sources and that of the books&rsquo; author. The source material was written by participants in and eyewitnesses of the events. It was reliable information, which was historically accurate concerning the sons of Israel, from the death of David and the accession of Solomon (971 B.C.) to the destruction of the temple and Jerusalem by the Babylonians (586 B.C.). Thus, Kings traces the histories of two sets of kings and two nations of disobedient people, Israel and Judah, both of whom were growing indifferent to God&rsquo;s law and His prophets and were headed for captivity.</p><p>The book of Kings is not only accurate history, but interpreted history. The author, an exile in Babylon, wished to communicate the lessons of Israel&rsquo;s history to the exiles. Specifically, he taught the exilic community why the Lord&rsquo;s judgment of exile had come. The writer established early in his narrative that the Lord required obedience by the kings to the Mosaic law, if their kingdom was to receive His blessing; disobedience would bring exile (1 Kin. 9:3&ndash;9). The sad reality that history revealed was that all the kings of Israel and the majority of the kings of Judah &ldquo;did evil in the sight of the LORD.&rdquo; These evil kings were apostates, who led their people to sin by not confronting idolatry, but sanctioning it. Because of the kings&rsquo; failure, the Lord sent His prophets to confront both the monarchs and the people with their sin and their need to return to Him. Because the message of the prophets was rejected, the prophets foretold that the nation(s) would be carried into exile (2 Kin. 17:13&ndash;23; 21:10&ndash;15). Like every prophecy uttered by the prophets in Kings, this word from the Lord came to pass (2 Kin. 17:5, 6; 25:1&ndash;11). Therefore, Kings interpreted the people&rsquo;s experience of exile and helped them to see why they had suffered God&rsquo;s punishment for idolatry. It also explained that just as God had shown mercy to Ahab (1 Kin. 22:27&ndash;29) and Jehoiachin (2 Kin. 25:27&ndash;30), so He was willing to show them mercy.</p><p>The predominant geographical setting of Kings is the whole Land of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba (1 Kin. 4:25), including Transjordan. Four invading nations played a dominant role in the affairs of Israel and Judah from 971 to 561 B.C. In the tenth century B.C., Egypt impacted Israel&rsquo;s history during the reigns of Solomon and Rehoboam (1 Kin. 3:1; 1:14&ndash;22, 40; 12:2; 14:25&ndash;27). Syria (Aram) posed a great threat to Israel&rsquo;s security during the ninth century B.C., ca. 890&ndash;800 B.C. (1 Kin. 15:9&ndash;22; 20:1&ndash;34; 22:1&ndash;4, 29&ndash;40; 2 Kin. 6:8&ndash;7:20; 8:7&ndash;15; 10:32, 33; 12:17&ndash;18; 13:22&ndash;25). The years from ca. 800&ndash;750 B.C. were a half-century of peace and prosperity for Israel and Judah, because Assyria neutralized Syria and did not threaten to the south. This changed during the kingship of Tiglath-Pileser III (2 Kin. 15:19, 20, 29). From the mid-eighth century to the late seventh century B.C., Assyria terrorized Palestine, finally conquering and destroying Israel (the northern kingdom) in 722 B.C. (2 Kin. 17:4&ndash;6) and besieging Jerusalem in 701 B.C. (2 Kin. 18:17&ndash;19:37). From 612 to 539 B.C., Babylon was the dominant power in the ancient world. Babylon invaded Judah (the southern kingdom) 3 times, with the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple occurring in 586 B.C. during that third assault (2 Kin. 24:1&ndash;25:21).</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>Kings concentrates, then, on the history of the sons of Israel from 971 to 561 B.C. First Kings 1:1&ndash;11:43 deals with Solomon&rsquo;s accession and reign (971&ndash;931 B.C.). The two divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah (931&ndash;722 B.C.) are covered in 1 Kin. 12:1; 2 Kin. 17:41. The author arranged the material in a distinctive way in that the narration follows the kings in both the N and the S. For each reign described, there is the following literary framework. Every king is introduced with: 1) his name and relation to his predecessor; 2) his date of accession in relationship to the year of the contemporary ruler in the other kingdom; 3) his age on coming to the throne (for kings of Judah only); 4) his length of reign; 5) his place of reign; 6) his mother&rsquo;s name (for Judah only); and 7) spiritual appraisal of his reign. This introduction is followed by a narration of the events that occurred during the reign of each king. The details of this narration vary widely. Each reign is concluded with: 1) a citation of sources; 2) additional historical notes; 3) notice of death; 4) notice of burial; 5) the name of the successor; and 6) in a few instances, an added postscript (i.e., 1 Kin. 15:32; 2 Kin. 10:36). Second Kings 18:1&ndash;25:21 deals with the time when Judah survived alone (722&ndash;586 B.C.). Two concluding paragraphs speak of events after the Babylonian exile (2 Kin. 25:22&ndash;26, 27&ndash;30).</p><p>Three theological themes are stressed in Kings. First, the Lord judged Israel and Judah because of their disobedience to His law (2 Kin 17:7&ndash;23). This unfaithfulness on the part of the people was furthered by the apostasy of the evil kings who led them into idolatry (2 Kin. 17:21, 22; 21:11), so the Lord exercised His righteous wrath against His rebellious people. Second, the word of the true prophets came to pass (1 Kin. 13:2, 3; 22:15&ndash;28; 2 Kin. 23:16; 24:2). This confirmed that the Lord did keep His Word, even His warnings of judgment. Third, the Lord remembered His promise to David (1 Kin. 11:12&ndash;13, 34&ndash;36; 15:4; 2 Kin. 8:19). Even though the kings of the Davidic line proved themselves to be disobedient to the Lord, He did not bring David&rsquo;s family to an end as He did the families of Jeroboam I, Omri, and Jehu in<br />Israel. Even as the book closes, the line of David still exists (2 Kin. 25:27&ndash;30), so there is hope for the coming &ldquo;seed&rdquo; of David (see 2 Sam. 7:12&ndash;16). The Lord is thus seen as faithful, and His Word is trustworthy.</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>The major interpretive challenge in Kings concerns the chronology of the kings of Israel and Judah. Though abundant chronological data is presented in the book of Kings, this data is difficult to interpret for two reasons. First, there seems to be internal inconsistency in the information given. For instance, 1 Kin. 16:23 states that Omri, king of Israel, began to reign in the 31st year of Asa, king of Judah, and that he reigned 12 years. But according to 1 Kin. 16:29, Omri was succeeded by his son Ahab in the 38th year of Asa, giving Omri a reign of only 7<br />years, not 12. Second, from extrabiblical sources (Greek, Assyrian, and Babylonian), correlated with astronomical data, a reliable series of dates can be calculated from 892 to 566 B.C. Since Ahab and Jehu, kings of Israel, are believed to be mentioned in Assyrian records, 853 B.C. can be fixed as the year of Ahab&rsquo;s death and 841 B.C. as the year Jehu began to reign. With these fixed dates, it is possible to work backward and forward to determine that the date of the division of Israel from Judah was ca. 931 B.C., the fall of Samaria 722 B.C., and the fall of Jerusalem 586 B.C. But when the total years of royal reigns in Kings are added, the number for Israel is 241 years (not the 210 years of 931 to 722 B.C.) and Judah 393 years (not the 346 years of 931 to 586 B.C.). It is recognized that in both kingdoms there were some co-regencies, i.e., a period of rulership when two kings, usually father and son, ruled at the same time, so the overlapping years were counted twice in the total for both kings. Further, different methods of reckoning the years of a king&rsquo;s rule and even different<br />calendars were used at differing times in the two kingdoms, resulting in the seeming internal inconsistencies. The general accuracy of the chronology in Kings can be demonstrated and confirmed.</p><p>A second major interpretive challenge deals with Solomon&rsquo;s relationship to the Abrahamic and Davidic Covenants. First Kings 4:20, 21 has been interpreted by some as the fulfillment of the promises given to Abraham (cf. Gen. 15:18&ndash;21; 22:17). However, according to Num. 34:6, the western border of the Land promised to Abraham was the Mediterranean Sea. In 1 Kin. 5:1ff., Hiram is seen as the independent king of Tyre (along the Mediterranean), dealing with Solomon as an equal. Solomon&rsquo;s empire was not the fulfillment of the Land promise given to Abraham by the Lord, although a great portion of that land was under Solomon&rsquo;s control. Further, the statements of Solomon in 1 Kin. 5:5 and 8:20 are his claims to be the promised seed of the Davidic Covenant (cf. 2 Sam. 7:12&ndash;16). The author of Kings holds out the possibility that Solomon&rsquo;s temple was the fulfillment of the Lord&rsquo;s promise to David. However, while the conditions for the fulfillment of the promise to David are reiterated to Solomon (1 Kin. 6:12), it is clear that Solomon did not meet these conditions (1 Kin. 11:9&ndash;13). In fact, none of the historical kings in the house of David met the condition of complete obedience that was to be the sign of the Promised One. According to Kings, the fulfillment of the Abrahamic and Davidic Covenants did not take place in Israel&rsquo;s past, thus laying the foundation for the latter prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the Twelve) who would point Israel to a future hope under Messiah when the Covenants would be fulfilled (see Is. 9:6, 7).</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p>Since the division of 1 and 2 Kings arbitrarily takes place in the middle of the narrative concerning King Ahaziah in Israel, the following outline is for both 1 and 2 Kings.</p><p><strong>I.

"12","12","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>First and Second Kings were originally one book, called in the Hebrew text, &ldquo;Kings,&rdquo; from the first word in 1:1. The Greek translation of the OT, the Septuagint (LXX), divided the book in two, and this was followed by the Latin Vulgate (Vg.) version and English translations. The division was for the convenience of copying this lengthy book on scrolls and codexes and was not based on features of content. Modern Hebrew Bibles title the books &ldquo;Kings A&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kings B.&rdquo; The LXX and Vg. connected Kings with the books of Samuel, so that the titles in the LXX are &ldquo;The Third and Fourth Books of Kingdoms&rdquo; and in the Vg. &ldquo;Third and Fourth Kings.&rdquo; The books of 1 and 2 Samuel and 1 and 2 Kings combined are a chronicle of the entire history of Judah&rsquo;s and Israel&rsquo;s kingship from Saul to Zedekiah. First and Second Chronicles provides only the history of Judah&rsquo;s monarchy.</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>Jewish tradition proposed that Jeremiah wrote Kings, though this is unlikely because the final event recorded in the book (see 2 Kin. 25:27&ndash;30) occurred in Babylon in 561 B.C. Jeremiah never went to Babylon, but to Egypt (Jer. 43:1&ndash;7), and would have been at least 86 years old by 561 B.C. Actually, the identity of the unnamed author remains unknown. Since the ministry of prophets is emphasized in Kings, it seems that the author was most likely an unnamed prophet of the Lord who lived in exile with Israel in Babylon.</p><p>Kings was written between 561&ndash;538 B.C. Since the last narrated event (2 Kin. 25:27&ndash;30) sets the earliest possible date of completion and because there is no record of the end of the Babylonian captivity in Kings, the release from exile (538 B.C.) identifies the latest possible writing date. This date is sometimes challenged on the basis of &ldquo;to this day&rdquo; statements in 1 Kin. 8:8; 9:13, 20, 21; 10:12; 12:19; 2 Kin. 2:22; 8:22; 10:27; 14:7; 16:6; 17:23, 34, 41; 21:15. However, it is best to understand these statements as those of the sources used by the<br />author, rather than statements of the author himself.<br /><br />It is clear that the author used a variety of sources in compiling this book, including &ldquo;the book of the acts of Solomon&rdquo; (1 Kin. 11:41), &ldquo;the chronicles of the kings of Israel&rdquo; (1 Kin. 14:19; 15:31; 16:5, 14, 20, 27; 22:39; 2 Kin. 1:18; 10:34; 13:8, 12; 14:15, 28; 15:11, 15, 21, 26, 31), and &ldquo;the chronicles of the kings of Judah&rdquo; (1 Kin. 14:29; 15:7, 23; 22:45; 2 Kin. 8:23; 12:19; 14:18; 15:6, 36; 16:19; 20:20; 21:17, 25; 23:28; 24:5). Further, Is. 36:1&ndash;39:8 provided information used in 2 Kin. 18:9&ndash;20:19, and Jer. 52:31&ndash;34 seems to be the source for 2 Kin. 25:27&ndash;29. This explanation posits a single inspired author, living in Babylon during the Exile, using these pre-Exilic source materials at his disposal.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>A distinction must be made between the setting of the books&rsquo; sources and that of the books&rsquo; author. The source material was written by participants in and eyewitnesses of the events. It was reliable information, which was historically accurate concerning the sons of Israel, from the death of David and the accession of Solomon (971 B.C.) to the destruction of the temple and Jerusalem by the Babylonians (586 B.C.). Thus, Kings traces the histories of two sets of kings and two nations of disobedient people, Israel and Judah, both of whom were growing indifferent to God&rsquo;s law and His prophets and were headed for captivity.</p><p>The book of Kings is not only accurate history, but interpreted history. The author, an exile in Babylon, wished to communicate the lessons of Israel&rsquo;s history to the exiles. Specifically, he taught the exilic community why the Lord&rsquo;s judgment of exile had come. The writer established early in his narrative that the Lord required obedience by the kings to the Mosaic law, if their kingdom was to receive His blessing; disobedience would bring exile (1 Kin. 9:3&ndash;9). The sad reality that history revealed was that all the kings of Israel and the majority of the kings of Judah &ldquo;did evil in the sight of the LORD.&rdquo; These evil kings were apostates, who led their people to sin by not confronting idolatry, but sanctioning it. Because of the kings&rsquo; failure, the Lord sent His prophets to confront both the monarchs and the people with their sin and their need to return to Him. Because the message of the prophets was rejected, the prophets foretold that the nation(s) would be carried into exile (2 Kin. 17:13&ndash;23; 21:10&ndash;15). Like every prophecy uttered by the prophets in Kings, this word from the Lord came to pass (2 Kin. 17:5, 6; 25:1&ndash;11). Therefore, Kings interpreted the people&rsquo;s experience of exile and helped them to see why they had suffered God&rsquo;s punishment for idolatry. It also explained that just as God had shown mercy to Ahab (1 Kin. 22:27&ndash;29) and Jehoiachin (2 Kin. 25:27&ndash;30), so He was willing to show them mercy.</p><p>The predominant geographical setting of Kings is the whole Land of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba (1 Kin. 4:25), including Transjordan. Four invading nations played a dominant role in the affairs of Israel and Judah from 971 to 561 B.C. In the tenth century B.C., Egypt impacted Israel&rsquo;s history during the reigns of Solomon and Rehoboam (1 Kin. 3:1; 1:14&ndash;22, 40; 12:2; 14:25&ndash;27). Syria (Aram) posed a great threat to Israel&rsquo;s security during the ninth century B.C., ca. 890&ndash;800 B.C. (1 Kin. 15:9&ndash;22; 20:1&ndash;34; 22:1&ndash;4, 29&ndash;40; 2 Kin. 6:8&ndash;7:20; 8:7&ndash;15; 10:32, 33; 12:17&ndash;18; 13:22&ndash;25). The years from ca. 800&ndash;750 B.C. were a half-century of peace and prosperity for Israel and Judah, because Assyria neutralized Syria and did not threaten to the south. This changed during the kingship of Tiglath-Pileser III (2 Kin. 15:19, 20, 29). From the mid-eighth century to the late seventh century B.C., Assyria terrorized Palestine, finally conquering and destroying Israel (the northern kingdom) in 722 B.C. (2 Kin. 17:4&ndash;6) and besieging Jerusalem in 701 B.C. (2 Kin. 18:17&ndash;19:37). From 612 to 539 B.C., Babylon was the dominant power in the ancient world. Babylon invaded Judah (the southern kingdom) 3 times, with the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple occurring in 586 B.C. during that third assault (2 Kin. 24:1&ndash;25:21).</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>Kings concentrates, then, on the history of the sons of Israel from 971 to 561 B.C. First Kings 1:1&ndash;11:43 deals with Solomon&rsquo;s accession and reign (971&ndash;931 B.C.). The two divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah (931&ndash;722 B.C.) are covered in 1 Kin. 12:1; 2 Kin. 17:41. The author arranged the material in a distinctive way in that the narration follows the kings in both the N and the S. For each reign described, there is the following literary framework. Every king is introduced with: 1) his name and relation to his predecessor; 2) his date of accession in relationship to the year of the contemporary ruler in the other kingdom; 3) his age on coming to the throne (for kings of Judah only); 4) his length of reign; 5) his place of reign; 6) his mother&rsquo;s name (for Judah only); and 7) spiritual appraisal of his reign. This introduction is followed by a narration of the events that occurred during the reign of each king. The details of this narration vary widely. Each reign is concluded with: 1) a citation of sources; 2) additional historical notes; 3) notice of death; 4) notice of burial; 5) the name of the successor; and 6) in a few instances, an added postscript (i.e., 1 Kin. 15:32; 2 Kin. 10:36). Second Kings 18:1&ndash;25:21 deals with the time when Judah survived alone (722&ndash;586 B.C.). Two concluding paragraphs speak of events after the Babylonian exile (2 Kin. 25:22&ndash;26, 27&ndash;30).</p><p>Three theological themes are stressed in Kings. First, the Lord judged Israel and Judah because of their disobedience to His law (2 Kin 17:7&ndash;23). This unfaithfulness on the part of the people was furthered by the apostasy of the evil kings who led them into idolatry (2 Kin. 17:21, 22; 21:11), so the Lord exercised His righteous wrath against His rebellious people. Second, the word of the true prophets came to pass (1 Kin. 13:2, 3; 22:15&ndash;28; 2 Kin. 23:16; 24:2). This confirmed that the Lord did keep His Word, even His warnings of judgment. Third, the Lord remembered His promise to David (1 Kin. 11:12&ndash;13, 34&ndash;36; 15:4; 2 Kin. 8:19). Even though the kings of the Davidic line proved themselves to be disobedient to the Lord, He did not bring David&rsquo;s family to an end as He did the families of Jeroboam I, Omri, and Jehu in<br />Israel. Even as the book closes, the line of David still exists (2 Kin. 25:27&ndash;30), so there is hope for the coming &ldquo;seed&rdquo; of David (see 2 Sam. 7:12&ndash;16). The Lord is thus seen as faithful, and His Word is trustworthy.</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>The major interpretive challenge in Kings concerns the chronology of the kings of Israel and Judah. Though abundant chronological data is presented in the book of Kings, this data is difficult to interpret for two reasons. First, there seems to be internal inconsistency in the information given. For instance, 1 Kin. 16:23 states that Omri, king of Israel, began to reign in the 31st year of Asa, king of Judah, and that he reigned 12 years. But according to 1 Kin. 16:29, Omri was succeeded by his son Ahab in the 38th year of Asa, giving Omri a reign of only 7<br />years, not 12. Second, from extrabiblical sources (Greek, Assyrian, and Babylonian), correlated with astronomical data, a reliable series of dates can be calculated from 892 to 566 B.C. Since Ahab and Jehu, kings of Israel, are believed to be mentioned in Assyrian records, 853 B.C. can be fixed as the year of Ahab&rsquo;s death and 841 B.C. as the year Jehu began to reign. With these fixed dates, it is possible to work backward and forward to determine that the date of the division of Israel from Judah was ca. 931 B.C., the fall of Samaria 722 B.C., and the fall of Jerusalem 586 B.C. But when the total years of royal reigns in Kings are added, the number for Israel is 241 years (not the 210 years of 931 to 722 B.C.) and Judah 393 years (not the 346 years of 931 to 586 B.C.). It is recognized that in both kingdoms there were some co-regencies, i.e., a period of rulership when two kings, usually father and son, ruled at the same time, so the overlapping years were counted twice in the total for both kings. Further, different methods of reckoning the years of a king&rsquo;s rule and even different<br />calendars were used at differing times in the two kingdoms, resulting in the seeming internal inconsistencies. The general accuracy of the chronology in Kings can be demonstrated and confirmed.</p><p>A second major interpretive challenge deals with Solomon&rsquo;s relationship to the Abrahamic and Davidic Covenants. First Kings 4:20, 21 has been interpreted by some as the fulfillment of the promises given to Abraham (cf. Gen. 15:18&ndash;21; 22:17). However, according to Num. 34:6, the western border of the Land promised to Abraham was the Mediterranean Sea. In 1 Kin. 5:1ff., Hiram is seen as the independent king of Tyre (along the Mediterranean), dealing with Solomon as an equal. Solomon&rsquo;s empire was not the fulfillment of the Land promise given to Abraham by the Lord, although a great portion of that land was under Solomon&rsquo;s control. Further, the statements of Solomon in 1 Kin. 5:5 and 8:20 are his claims to be the promised seed of the Davidic Covenant (cf. 2 Sam. 7:12&ndash;16). The author of Kings holds out the possibility that Solomon&rsquo;s temple was the fulfillment of the Lord&rsquo;s promise to David. However, while the conditions for the fulfillment of the promise to David are reiterated to Solomon (1 Kin. 6:12), it is clear that Solomon did not meet these conditions (1 Kin. 11:9&ndash;13). In fact, none of the historical kings in the house of David met the condition of complete obedience that was to be the sign of the Promised One. According to Kings, the fulfillment of the Abrahamic and Davidic Covenants did not take place in Israel&rsquo;s past, thus laying the foundation for the latter prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the Twelve) who would point Israel to a future hope under Messiah when the Covenants would be fulfilled (see Is. 9:6, 7).</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p>Since the division of 1 and 2 Kings arbitrarily takes place in the middle of the narrative concerning King Ahaziah in Israel, the following outline is for both 1 and 2 Kings.</p><p><strong>I.

"13","13","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>The original title in the Hebrew Bible read &ldquo;The annals (i.e., events or happenings) of the days.&rdquo; First and Second Chronicles were comprised of one book until later divided into separate books in the Greek OT translation, the Septuagint (LXX), ca. 200 B.C. The title also changed at that time to the inaccurate title, &ldquo;the things omitted,&rdquo; i.e., reflecting material not in 1, 2 Samuel and 1, 2 Kings. The English title &ldquo;Chronicles&rdquo; originated with Jerome&rsquo;s Latin Vulgate translation (ca. 400 A.D.), which used the fuller title &ldquo;The Chronicles of the Entire Sacred History.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>Neither 1 nor 2 Chronicles contains direct statements regarding the human author, though Jewish tradition strongly favors Ezra the priest (cf. Ezra 7:1&ndash;6) as &ldquo;the chronicler.&rdquo; These records were most likely recorded ca. 450&ndash;430 B.C. The genealogical record in 1 Chr. 1&ndash;9 supports a date after 450 B.C. for the writing. The NT does not directly quote either 1 or 2 Chronicles.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>The immediate historical backdrop encompassed the Jews&rsquo; three-phase return to the Promised Land from the Babylonian exile: 1) Zerubbabel in Ezra 1&ndash;6 (ca. 538 B.C.); 2) Ezra in Ezra 7&ndash;10 (ca. 458 B.C.); and 3) Nehemiah in Neh. 1&ndash;13 (ca. 445 B.C.). Previous history looks back to the Babylonian deportation/Exile (ca. 605&ndash;538 B.C.) as predicted/reported by 2 Kings, Esther, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, and Habakkuk. The prophets of this restoration era were Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.</p><p>The Jews had returned from their 70 years of captivity (ca. 538 B.C.) to a land that was markedly different from the one once ruled by King David (ca. 1011&ndash;971 B.C.) and King Solomon (971&ndash;931 B.C.): 1) there was no Hebrew king, but rather a Persian governor (Ezra 5:3; 6:6); 2) there was no security for Jerusalem, so Nehemiah had to rebuild the wall (Neh. 1&ndash;7); 3) there was no temple, so Zerubbabel had to reconstruct a pitiful semblance of the Solomonic temple&rsquo;s former glory (Ezra 3); 4) the Jews no longer dominated the region, but rather were on the defensive (Ezra 4; Neh. 4); 5) they enjoyed few divine blessings beyond the fact of their return; 6) they possessed little of the kingdom&rsquo;s former wealth; and 7) God&rsquo;s divine presence no longer resided in Jerusalem, having departed ca. 597&ndash;591 B.C. (Ezek. 8&ndash;11).</p><p>To put it mildly, their future looked bleak compared to their majestic past, especially the time of David and Solomon. The return could best be described as bittersweet, i.e., bitter because their present poverty brought hurtful memories about what was forfeited by God&rsquo;s judgment on their ancestors&rsquo; sin, but sweet because at least they were back in the Land God had given Abraham 17 centuries earlier (Gen. 12:1&ndash;3). The chronicler&rsquo;s selective genealogy and history of Israel, stretching from Adam (1 Chr. 1:1) to the return from Babylon (2 Chr. 26:23), was intended to remind the Jews of God&rsquo;s promises and intentions about: 1) the Land; 2) the nation; 3) the Davidic king; 4) the Levitical priests; 5) the temple; and 6) true worship, none of which had been abrogated because of the Babylonian captivity. All of this was to remind them of their spiritual heritage during the difficult times they faced, and to encourage them to be faithful to God.</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>First and Second Chronicles, as named by Jerome, recreate an OT history in miniature, with particular emphases on the Davidic Covenant and temple worship. In terms of literary parallel, 1 Chronicles is the partner of 2 Samuel, in that both detail the reign of King David. First Chronicles opens with Adam (1:1) and closes with the death of David (29:26&ndash;30) in 971 B.C. Second Chronicles begins with Solomon (1:1) and covers the same historical period as 1 and 2 Kings, while focusing exclusively on the kings of the southern kingdom of Judah, thus excluding the history of the northern 10 tribes and their rulers, because of their complete wickedness and false worship. It ranges from the reign of Solomon (1:1) in 971 B.C. to the return from Babylon in 538 B.C. (36:23). Over 55 percent of the material in Chronicles is unique, i.e., not found in 2 Samuel or 1 and 2 Kings. The &ldquo;chronicler&rdquo; tended to omit what was negative or in opposition to the Davidic kingship; on the other hand, he tended to make unique contributions in validating temple worship and the line of David. Whereas 2 Kings 25 ends dismally with the deportation of Judah to Babylon, 2 Chronicles 36:22&ndash;23 concludes hopefully with the Jews&rsquo; release from Persia and return to Jerusalem.</p><p>These two books were written to the repatriated Jewish exiles as a chronicle of God&rsquo;s intention of future blessing, in spite of the nation&rsquo;s past moral/spiritual failure for which the people paid dearly under God&rsquo;s wrath. First and Second Chronicles could be briefly summarized as follows:</p><blockquote><p>I. A Selected Genealogical History of Israel (1 Chr. 1&ndash;9)<br />II. Israel&rsquo;s United Kingdom Under Saul (1 Chr. 10), David (1 Chr. 11&ndash;29), and Solomon (2 Chr. 1&ndash;9)<br />III. Judah&rsquo;s Monarchy in the Divided Kingdom (2 Chr. 10&ndash;36:21)<br />IV. Judah&rsquo;s Release From Their Seventy Year Captivity (2 Chr. 36:22, 23).</p></blockquote><p>The historical themes are inextricably linked with the theological in that God&rsquo;s divine purposes for Israel have been and will be played out on the stage of human history. These two books are designed to assure the returning Jews that, in spite of their checkered past and present plight, God will be true to His covenant promises. They have been returned by God to the Land first given to Abraham as a race of people whose ethnic identity (Jewish) was not obliterated by the deportation and whose national identity (Israel) has been preserved (Gen. 12:1&ndash;3; 15:5), although they are still under God&rsquo;s judgment as prescribed by the Mosaic legislation (Deut. 28:15&ndash;68). The priestly line of Eleazar&rsquo;s son Phinehas and the Levitical line were still intact so that temple worship could continue in the hopes that God&rsquo;s presence would one day return (Num. 25:10&ndash;13; Mal. 3:1). The Davidic promise of a king was still valid, although future in its fulfillment (2 Sam. 7:8&ndash;17; 1 Chr. 17:7&ndash;15). Their individual hope of eternal life and restoration of God&rsquo;s blessings forever rested in the New Covenant (Jer. 31:31&ndash;34).</p><p>Two basic principles enumerated in these two books prevail throughout the OT, namely, obedience brings blessing, disobedience brings judgment. In the Chronicles, when the king obeyed and trusted the Lord, God blessed and protected. But when the king disobeyed and/or put his trust in something or someone other than the Lord, God withdrew His blessing and protection. Three basic failures by the kings of Judah brought God&rsquo;s wrath: 1) personal sin; 2) false worship/idolatry; and/or 3) trust in man rather than God.</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>First and Second Chronicles present a combination of selective genealogical and historical records and no insurmountable challenges within the two books are encountered. A few issues arise, such as: 1) Who wrote 1 and 2 Chronicles? Does the overlap of 2 Chr. 36:22&ndash;23 with Ezra 1:1&ndash;3 point to Ezra as author? 2) Does the use of multiple sources taint the inerrancy doctrine of Scripture? 3) How does one explain the variations in the genealogies of 1 Chr. 1&ndash;9 from other OT genealogies? 4) Are the curses of Deut. 28 still in force, even though the 70 year<br />captivity has concluded? 5) How does one explain the few variations in numbers when comparing Chronicles with parallel passages in Samuel and Kings?

"15","15","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>Even though Ezra&rsquo;s name does not enter the account of Judah&rsquo;s post-Exilic return to Jerusalem until 7:1, the book bears his name (&ldquo;Jehovah helps&rdquo;) as a title. This is because both Jewish and Christian tradition attribute authorship to this famous scribe-priest. New Testament writers do not quote the book of Ezra.</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>Ezra is most likely the author of both Ezra and Nehemiah, which might have originally been one book. Ezra 4:8&ndash;6:18 and 7:12&ndash;26 are written in Aramaic. Although Ezra never states his authorship, internal arguments favor him strongly. After his arrival in Jerusalem (ca. 458 B.C.), he changed from writing in the third person to writing in the first person. In the earlier section it is likely that he had used the third person because he was quoting his memoirs. Ezra is believed to possibly be the author of the books of the Chronicles. It would have been natural for the same author to continue the OT narrative by showing how God fulfilled His promise by returning His people to the Land after 70 years of captivity. There is also a strong priestly tone in Chronicles, and Ezra was a priestly descendant of Aaron (cf. 7:1&ndash;5). The concluding verses of 2 Chronicles (36:22, 23) are virtually identical to the beginning verses of Ezra (1:1&ndash;3a), affirming his authorship of both.</p><p>Ezra was a scribe who had access to the myriad of administrative documents found in Ezra and Nehemiah, especially those in the book of Ezra. Very few people would have been allowed access to the royal archives of the Persian Empire, but Ezra proved to be the exception (cf. Ezra 1:2&ndash;4; 4:9&ndash;22; 5:7&ndash;17; 6:3&ndash;12). His role as a scribe of the law is spelled out in 7:10: &ldquo;For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the Law of the LORD, and to do it, and to teach statutes and ordinances in Israel.&rdquo; He was a strong and godly man who lived at the time of Nehemiah (cf. Neh. 8:1&ndash;9; 12:36). Tradition says he was founder of the Great Synagogue, where the complete OT canon was first formally recognized.</p><p>Ezra led the second return from Persia (ca. 458 B.C.), so the completed book was written sometime in the next several decades (ca. 457&ndash;444 B.C.).</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>God had originally brought Israel out of the slave markets of Egypt in the Exodus (ca. 1445 B.C.). Hundreds of years later, before the events of Ezra, God told His people that if they chose to break their covenant with Him, He would again allow other nations to take them into slavery (Jer. 2:14&ndash;25). In spite of God&rsquo;s repeated warnings from the mouths of His prophets, Israel and Judah chose to reject their Lord and to participate in the worship of foreign gods, in addition to committing the abominable practices which accompanied idolatry (cf. 2 Kin. 17:7&ndash;18; Jer. 2:7&ndash;13). True to His promise, God brought the Assyrians and Babylonians to issue His chastisement upon wayward Israel and Judah.</p><p>In 722 B.C. the Assyrians deported the 10 northern tribes and scattered them all over their empire (cf. 2 Kin. 17:24&ndash;41; Is. 7:8). Several centuries later, in 605&ndash;586 B.C., God used the Babylonians to sack and nearly depopulate Jerusalem. Because Judah persisted in her unfaithfulness to the covenant, God chastened His people with 70 years of captivity (Jer. 25:11), from which they returned to Jerusalem as reported by Ezra and Nehemiah. Cyrus, the Persian, overthrew Babylon in 539 B.C., and the book of Ezra begins with the decree of Cyrus one year later for the Jews to return to Jerusalem (ca. 538 B.C.), and it chronicles the reestablishment of Judah&rsquo;s national calendar of feasts and sacrifices, including the rebuilding of the second temple (begun in 536 B.C. and completed in 516 B.C.).</p><p>As there had been 3 waves of deportation from Israel into Babylon (605 B.C., 597 B.C., and 586 B.C.), so there were actually 3 returns to Jerusalem over a 9-decade span. Zerubbabel first returned in 538 B.C. He was followed by Ezra, who led the second return in 458 B.C. Nehemiah did likewise 13 years later, in 445 B.C. Complete uncontested political autonomy, however, never returned. The prophets Haggai and Zechariah preached during Zerubbabel&rsquo;s time, about 520 B.C. and following.</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>The Jews&rsquo; return from the Babylonian captivity seemed like a second Exodus, sovereignly patterned in some ways after Israel&rsquo;s first redemption from Egyptian bondage. The return trip from Babylon involved activities similar to those of the original Exodus: 1) the rebuilding of<br />the temple and the city walls; 2) the reinstitution of the law, which made Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah collectively seem like a second Moses; 3) the challenge of the local enemies; and 4) the temptation to intermarry with non-Jews, resulting in idolatry. Other parallels between the original Exodus and the return from Babylon must have seemed to the returnees like they were given a fresh start by God.</p><p>In his account of the return, Ezra drew upon a collection of Persian administrative documents to which he had access as a scribe. The presence of actual royal administrative documents carries a powerful message when accompanied by the resounding line &ldquo;the hand of the LORD my God was upon him/me&rdquo;(7:6, 28). The decrees, proclamations, letters, lists, genealogies, and memoranda, many of them written by the Persian administration, attest to the sovereign hand of God in Israel&rsquo;s restoration. The primary message of the book is that God orchestrated the past grim situation (captivity) and would continue to work through a pagan king and his successors to give Judah hope for the future (return). God&rsquo;s administration overrides that of any of the kings of this world, and thus the book of Ezra is a message of God&rsquo;s continuing covenant grace to Israel.</p><p>Another prominent theme which surfaces in Ezra is opposition from the local Samaritan residents whose ancestors had been imported from Assyria (4:2; cf. John 4:4&ndash;42). For reasons of spiritual sabotage, Israel&rsquo;s enemies requested to participate in rebuilding the temple (4:1, 2). After being shunned, the enemies hired counselors against the Jews (cf. 4:4, 5). But the Lord, through the preaching of Haggai and Zechariah, rekindled the spirit of the people and their leaders to build, with the words &ldquo; &hellip; be strong &hellip; and work; for I am with you&rdquo; (Hag. 2:4; cf. Ezra 4:24&ndash;5:2). The reconstruction resumed (ca. 520 B.C.) and the temple was soon finished, dedicated, and back in service to God (ca. 516 B.C.).</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>First, how do the post-Exilic historical books of 1 and 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther relate to the post-Exilic prophets Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi? For the chronology of Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther, see the notes on Ezra 6:22&ndash;7:1. The two books of Chronicles were written by Ezra as a reminder of the promised Davidic kingship, the Aaronic priesthood, and appropriate temple worship. Haggai and Zechariah prophesied in the period of Ezra 4&ndash;6 when temple construction was resumed. Malachi wrote during Nehemiah&rsquo;s revisit to Persia (cf. Neh. 13:6).</p><p>Second, what purpose does the book serve? Ezra historically reports the first two of three post-Exilic returns to Jerusalem from the Babylonian captivity. The first return (chaps. 1&ndash;6) was under Zerubbabel (ca. 538 B.C.) and the second (chaps. 7&ndash;10) was led by Ezra himself (ca.<br />458 B.C.). Spiritually, Ezra reestablished the importance of the Aaronic priesthood by tracing his ancestry to Eleazar, Phinehas, and Zadok (cf. Ezra 7:1&ndash;5). He reported on the rebuilding of the second temple (chaps. 3&ndash;6). How he dealt with the gross sin of intermarriage with foreigners is presented in chaps. 9, 10. Most importantly, he reports how the sovereign hand of God moved kings and overcame varied opposition to reestablish Israel as Abraham&rsquo;s seed, nationally and individually, in the land promised to Abraham, David, and Jeremiah.</p><p>Third, the temple was built during the reign of Cyrus. Mention of Ahasuerus (4:6) and Artaxerxes (4:7&ndash;23) might lead one to conclude that the temple could also have been built during their reigns. Such a conclusion, however, violates history. Ezra was not writing about the construction accomplishments of Ahasuerus or Artaxerxes, but rather he continued to chronicle their oppositions after the temple was built, which continued even to Ezra&rsquo;s day. It is apparent, then, that Ezra 4:1&ndash;5 and 4:24&ndash;5:2 deal with rebuilding the temple under Zerubbabel, while 4:6&ndash;23 is a parenthesis recounting the history of opposition in the times of Ezra and Nehemiah.</p><p>Fourth, the interpreter must decide where Esther fits in to the time of Ezra. A careful examination indicates it took place between the events of chaps. 6 and 7. <em><a href=""http://www.gty.org/resources/Resources/Bible+Introductions/MSB17"">See notes on Esther</a></em>.</p><p>Fifth, how does divorce in Ezra 10 correlate with the fact that God hates divorce (Mal. 2:16)? Ezra does not establish the norm, but rather deals with a special case in history. It seems to have been decided (Ezra 10:3) on the principle that the lesser wrong (divorce) would be preferable to the greater wrong of the Jewish race being polluted by intermarriage, so that the nation and the messianic line of David would not be ended by being mingled with Gentiles. To solve the problem this way magnifies the mercy of God in that the only other solution would have been to kill all of those involved (husband, wives, and children) by stoning, as was done during the first Exodus at Shittim (Num. 25:1&ndash;9).</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I.

"16","16","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>Nehemiah (&ldquo;Jehovah comforts&rdquo;) is a famous cupbearer, who never appears in Scripture outside of this book. As with the books of Ezra and Esther, named after his contemporaries (see Introductions to <a href=""http://www.gty.org/resources/Resources/Bible+Introductions/MSB15""><strong>Ezra</strong></a> and <a href=""http://www.gty.org/resources/Resources/Bible+Introductions/MSB17""><strong>Esther</strong></a>), the book recounts selected events of his leadership and was titled after him. Both the Greek Septuagint (LXX) and the Latin Vulgate named this book &ldquo;Second Ezra.&rdquo; Even though the two books of Ezra and Nehemiah are separate in most English Bibles, they may have once been joined together in a single unit as currently in the Hebrew texts. New Testament writers do not quote Nehemiah.</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>Though much of this book was clearly drawn from Nehemiah&rsquo;s personal diaries and written from his first person perspective (1:1&ndash;7:5; 12:27&ndash;43; 13:4&ndash;31), both Jewish and Christian traditions recognize Ezra as the author. This is based on external evidence that Ezra and Nehemiah were originally one book as reflected in the LXX and Vulgate; it is also based on internal evidence such as the recurrent &ldquo;hand of the LORD&rdquo; theme which dominates both Ezra and Nehemiah and the author&rsquo;s role as a priest-scribe. As a scribe, he had access to the royal archives of Persia, which accounts for the myriad of administrative documents found recorded in the two books, especially in the book of Ezra. Very few people would have been allowed access to the royal archives of the Persian Empire, but Ezra proved to be the exception (cf. Ezra 1:2&ndash;4; 4:9&ndash;22; 5:7&ndash;17; 6:3&ndash;12).</p><p>The events in Nehemiah 1 commence late in the year 446 B.C., the 20th year of the Persian king, Artaxerxes (464&ndash;423 B.C.). The book follows chronologically from Nehemiah&rsquo;s first term as governor of Jerusalem ca. 445&ndash;433 B.C. (Neh. 1&ndash;12) to his second term, possibly beginning ca. 424 B.C. (Neh. 13). Nehemiah was written by Ezra sometime during or after Nehemiah&rsquo;s second term, but no later than 400 B.C.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>True to God&rsquo;s promise of judgment, He brought the Assyrians and Babylonians to deliver His chastisement upon wayward Judah and Israel. In 722 B.C. the Assyrians deported the 10 northern tribes and scattered them all over the then known world (2 Kin. 17). Several centuries later, ca. 605&ndash;586 B.C., God used the Babylonians to sack, destroy, and nearly depopulate Jerusalem (2 Kin. 25) because Judah had persisted in her unfaithfulness to the covenant. God chastened His people with 70 years of captivity in Babylon (Jer. 25:11).</p><p>During the Jews&rsquo; captivity, world empire leadership changed hands from the Babylonians to the Persians (ca. 539 B.C.; Dan. 5), after which Daniel received most of his prophetic revelation (cf. Dan. 6, 9&ndash;12). The book of Ezra begins with the decree of Cyrus, a Persian king, to return God&rsquo;s people to Jerusalem to rebuild God&rsquo;s house (ca. 539 B.C.), and chronicles the reestablishment of Judah&rsquo;s national calendar of feasts and sacrifices. Zerubbabel and Joshua led the first return (Ezra 1&ndash;6) and rebuilt the temple. Esther gives a glimpse of the Jews left in Persia (ca. 483&ndash;473 B.C.) when Haman attempted to eliminate the Jewish race. Ezra 7&ndash;10 recounts the second return led by Ezra in 458 B.C. Nehemiah chronicles the third return to rebuild the wall around Jerusalem (ca. 445 B.C.).</p><p>At that time in Judah&rsquo;s history, the Persian Empire dominated the entire Near Eastern world. Its administration of Judah, although done with a loose hand, was mindful of disruptions or any signs of rebellion from its vassals. Rebuilding the walls of conquered cities posed the most glaring threat to the Persian central administration. Only a close confidant of the king himself could be trusted for such an operation. At the most critical juncture in Judah&rsquo;s revitalization, God raised up Nehemiah to exercise one of the most trusted roles in the empire, the King&rsquo;s cupbearer and confidant. Life under the Persian king Artaxerxes (ca. 464&ndash;423 B.C.) had its advantages for Nehemiah. Much like Joseph, Esther, and Daniel, he had attained a significant role in the palace which then ruled the ancient world, a position from which God could use him to lead the rebuilding of Jerusalem&rsquo;s walls in spite of its implications for Persian control of that city.</p><p>Several other historical notes are of interest. First, Esther was Artaxerxes&rsquo; stepmother and could have easily influenced him to look favorably upon the Jews, especially Nehemiah. Second, Daniel&rsquo;s prophetic 70 weeks began with the decree to rebuild the city issued by Artaxerxes in 445 B.C. (cf. chaps. 1, 2). Third, the Elephantine papyri (Egyptian documents), dated to the late 5th century B.C., support the account of Nehemiah by mentioning Sanballat the governor of Samaria (2:19), Jehohanan (6:18; 12:23), and Nehemiah&rsquo;s being replaced as governor of Jerusalem by Bigvai (ca. 410 B.C; Neh. 10:16). Finally, Nehemiah and Malachi represent the last of the OT canonical writings, both in terms of the time the events occurred (Mal. 1&ndash;4; Neh. 13) and the time when they were recorded by Ezra. Thus the next messages from God for Israel do not come until over 400 years of silence had passed, after which the births of John the Baptist and Jesus Christ were announced (Matt. 1; Luke 1, 2).</p><p>With the full OT revelation of Israel&rsquo;s history prior to Christ&rsquo;s incarnation being completed, the Jews had not yet experienced the fullness of God&rsquo;s various covenants and promises to them. While there was a Jewish remnant, as promised to Abraham (cf. Gen. 15:5), it does not appear to be even as large as at the time of the Exodus (Num. 1:46). The Jews neither possessed the Land (Gen. 15:7) nor did they rule as a sovereign nation (Gen. 12:2). The Davidic throne was unoccupied (cf. 2 Sam. 7:16), although the High-Priest was of the line of Eleazar and Phinehas (cf. Num. 25:10&ndash;13). God&rsquo;s promise to consummate the New Covenant of redemption awaited the birth, crucifixion, and resurrection of Messiah (cf. Heb. 7&ndash;10).</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>Careful attention to the reading of God&rsquo;s Word in order to perform His will is a constant theme. The spiritual revival came in response to Ezra&rsquo;s reading of &ldquo;the Book of the Law of Moses&rdquo; (8:1). After the reading, Ezra and some of the priests carefully explained its meaning to the people in attendance (8:8). The next day, Ezra met with some of the fathers of the households, the priests, and Levites, &ldquo;in order to understand the words of the Law&rdquo; (8:13). The sacrificial system was carried on with careful attention to perform it &ldquo;as it is written in the Law&rdquo; (10:34, 36). So deep was their concern to abide by God&rsquo;s revealed will that they took &ldquo;a curse and an oath to walk in God&rsquo;s Law &hellip; &rdquo; (10:29). When the marriage reforms were carried out, they acted in accordance with that which &ldquo;they read from the Book of Moses&rdquo; (13:1).</p><p>A second major theme, the obedience of Nehemiah, is explicitly referred to throughout the book due to the fact that the book is based on the memoirs or first person accounts of Nehemiah. God worked through the obedience of Nehemiah; however, He also worked through the wrongly-motivated, wicked hearts of His enemies. Nehemiah&rsquo;s enemies failed, not so much as a result of the success of Nehemiah&rsquo;s strategies, but because &ldquo;God had brought their plot to nothing&rdquo; (4:15). God used the opposition of Judah&rsquo;s enemies to drive His people to their knees in the same way that He used the favor of Cyrus to return His people to the Land, to fund their building project, and to even protect the reconstruction of Jerusalem&rsquo;s walls. Not surprisingly, Nehemiah acknowledged the true motive of his strategy to repopulate<br />Jerusalem: &ldquo;my God put it into my heart&rdquo; (7:5). It was He who accomplished it.</p><p>Another theme in Nehemiah, as in Ezra, is opposition. Judah&rsquo;s enemies started rumors that God&rsquo;s people had revolted against Persia. The goal was to intimidate Judah into forestalling reconstruction of the walls. In spite of opposition from without and heartbreaking corruption and dissension from within, Judah completed the walls of Jerusalem in only 52 days (6:15), experienced revival after the reading of the law by Ezra (8:1ff.), and celebrated the Feast of Tabernacles (8:14ff.; ca. 445 B.C.).</p><p>The book&rsquo;s detailed insight into the personal thoughts, motives, and disappointments of Nehemiah makes it easy for the reader to primarily identify with him, rather than &ldquo;the sovereign hand of God&rdquo; theme and the primary message of His control and intervention into the affairs of His people and their enemies. But the exemplary behavior of the famous cupbearer is eclipsed by God who orchestrated the reconstruction of the walls in spite of much opposition and many setbacks; the &ldquo;good hand of God&rdquo; theme carries through the book of Nehemiah (1:10; 2:8, 18).</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>First, since much of Nehemiah is explained in relationship to Jerusalem&rsquo;s gates (cf. Neh. 2, 3, 8, 12), one needs to see the map &ldquo;Jerusalem in Nehemiah&rsquo;s Day&rdquo; for an orientation. Second, the reader must recognize that the time line of chapters 1&ndash;12 encompassed about one year (445 B.C.), followed by a long gap of time (over 20 years) after Neh. 12 and before Neh. 13. Finally, it must be recognized that Nehemiah actually served two governorships in Jerusalem, the first from 445&ndash;433 B.C. (cf. Neh. 5:14; 13:6) and the second beginning possibly in 424 B.C. and extending to no longer than 410 B.C.</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I.

"17","17","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Esther&rdquo; serves as the title without variation through the ages. This book and the book of Ruth are the only OT books named after women. Like Song of Solomon, Obadiah, and Nahum, the NT does not quote or allude to Esther. &ldquo;Hadassah&rdquo; (2:7), meaning &ldquo;myrtle,&rdquo; was the Hebrew name of Esther, which came either from the Persian word &ldquo;star&rdquo; or possibly from the name of the Babylonian love goddess, Ishtar. As the orphaned daughter of her father Abihail, Esther grew up in Persia with her older cousin, Mordecai, who raised her as if she were his own daughter (2:7, 15).</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>The author remains unknown, although Mordecai, Ezra, and Nehemiah have been suggested. Whoever penned Esther possessed a detailed knowledge of Persian customs, etiquette, and history, plus particular familiarity with the palace at Shushan (1:5&ndash;7). He also exhibited intimate knowledge of the Hebrew calendar and customs, while additionally showing a strong sense of Jewish nationalism. Possibly a Persian Jew, who later moved back to Israel, wrote Esther.</p><p>Esther appears as the 17th book in the literary chronology of the OT and closes the OT historical section. Only Ezra 7&ndash;10, Nehemiah, and Malachi report later OT history than Esther. The account in Esther ends in 473 B.C. before Ahasuerus died by assassination (ca. 465 B.C.). Esther 10:2 speaks as though Ahasuerus&rsquo; reign has been completed, so the earliest possible writing date would be after his reign around mid-fifth century B.C. The latest reasonable date would be prior to 331 B.C. when Greece conquered Persia.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>Esther occurred during the Persian period of world history, ca. 539 B.C. (Dan. 5:30, 31) to ca. 331 B.C. (Dan. 8:1&ndash;27). Ahasuerus ruled from ca. 486 to 465 B.C.; Esther covers the 483&ndash;473 B.C. portion of his reign. The name Ahasuerus represents the Heb. transliteration of the Persian name &ldquo;Khshayarsha,&rdquo; while &ldquo;Xerxes&rdquo; represents his Greek name.</p><p>The events of Esther occurred during the wider time span between the first return of the Jews after the 70 year captivity in Babylon (Dan. 9:1&ndash;19) under Zerubbabel ca. 538 B.C. (Ezra 1&ndash;6) and the second return led by Ezra ca. 458 B.C. (Ezra 7&ndash;10). Nehemiah&rsquo;s journey (the third return) from Susa to Jerusalem (Neh. 1&ndash;2) occurred later (ca. 445 B.C.).</p><p>Esther and Exodus both chronicle how vigorously foreign powers tried to eliminate the Jewish race and how God sovereignly preserved His people in accordance with His covenant promise to Abraham ca. 2100&ndash;2075 B.C. (Gen. 12:1&ndash;3; 17:1&ndash;8). As a result of God&rsquo;s prevailing, Esther 9, 10 records the beginning of Purim&mdash;a new annual festival in the 12th month (Feb.- Mar.) to celebrate the nation&rsquo;s survival. Purim became one of two festivals given outside of the Mosaic legislation to still be celebrated in Israel (Hanukkah, or the Festival of Lights, is the other, cf. John 10:22).</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>All 167 verses of Esther have ultimately been accepted as canonical, although the absence of God&rsquo;s name anywhere has caused some to unnecessarily doubt its authenticity. The Greek Septuagint (LXX) added an extra 107 apocryphal verses which supposedly compensated for this lack. Along with Song of Solomon, Ruth, Ecclesiastes, and Lamentations, Esther stands with the OT books of the Megilloth, or &ldquo;5 scrolls.&rdquo; Rabbis read these books in the synagogue on 5 special occasions during the year&mdash;Esther being read at Purim (cf. 9:20&ndash;32).</p><p>The historical genesis for the drama played out between Mordecai (a Benjamite descendant of Saul&mdash;2:5) and Haman (an Agagite&mdash;3:1, 10; 8:3, 5; 9:24) goes back almost 1,000 years when the Jews exited from Egypt (ca. 1445 B.C.) and were attacked by the Amalekites (Ex. 17:8&ndash;16), whose lineage began with Amalek, son of Esau (Gen. 36:12). God pronounced His curse on the Amalekites, which resulted in their total elimination as a people (Ex. 17:14; Deut. 25:17&ndash;19). Although Saul (ca. 1030 B.C.) received orders to kill all the Amalekites, including their king Agag (1 Sam. 15:2, 3), he disobeyed (1 Sam. 15:7&ndash;9) and incurred God&rsquo;s displeasure (1 Sam. 15:11, 26; 28:18). Samuel finally hacked Agag into pieces (1 Sam. 15:32, 33). Because of his lineage from Agag, Haman carried deep hostility toward the Jews.</p><p>The time of Esther arrived 550 years after the death of Agag, but in spite of such passage of time, neither Haman the Agagite nor Mordecai the Benjamite had forgotten the tribal feud that still smoldered in their souls. This explains why Mordecai refused to bow down to Haman (3:2, 3) and why Haman so viciously attempted to exterminate the Jewish race (3:5, 6, 13). As expected, God&rsquo;s prophecy to extinguish the Amalekites (Ex. 17:14; Deut. 25:17&ndash;19) and God&rsquo;s promise to preserve the Jews (Gen. 17:1&ndash;8) prevailed.<br /><br />Because of God&rsquo;s faithfulness to save His people, the festival of Purim (named after the Akkadian word for &ldquo;lot&rdquo;&mdash;3:7; 9:26), an annual, two day holiday of feasting, rejoicing, sending food to one another, and giving gifts to the poor (9:21, 22), was decreed to be celebrated in every generation, by every family, in every province and city (9:27, 28). Esther later added a new feature of fasting with lamentation (9:31). Purim is not biblically mentioned again, although it has been celebrated throughout the centuries in Israel. Esther could be compared to a chess game. God and Satan (as invisible players) moved real kings, queens, and nobles. When Satan put Haman into place, it was as if he announced &ldquo;Check.&rdquo; God then positioned Esther and Mordecai in order to put Satan into &ldquo;Checkmate!&rdquo; Ever since the fall of man (Gen. 3:1&ndash;19), Satan has attempted to spiritually sever God&rsquo;s relationship with His human creation and disrupt God&rsquo;s covenant promises with Israel. For example, Christ&rsquo;s line through the tribe of Judah had been murderously reduced to Joash alone, who was rescued and preserved (2 Chr. 22:10&ndash;12). Later, Herod slaughtered the infants of Bethlehem, thinking Christ was among them (Matt. 2:16). Satan tempted Christ to denounce God and worship him (Matt. 4:9). Peter, at Satan&rsquo;s insistence, tried to block Christ&rsquo;s journey to Calvary (Matt. 16:22). Finally, Satan entered into Judas who then betrayed Christ to the Jews and Romans (Luke 22:3&ndash;6). While God was not mentioned in Esther, He was everywhere apparent as the One who opposed and foiled Satan&rsquo;s diabolical schemes by providential intervention.</p><p>In Esther, all of God&rsquo;s unconditional covenant promises to Abraham (Gen. 17:1&ndash;8) and to David (2 Sam. 7:8&ndash;16) were jeopardized. However, God&rsquo;s love for Israel is nowhere more apparent than in this dramatic rescue of His people from pending elimination. &ldquo;Behold, He who keeps Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep&rdquo; (Ps. 121:4).</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>The most obvious question raised by Esther comes from the fact that God is nowhere mentioned, as in Song of Solomon. Nor does the writer or any participant refer to the law of God, the Levitical sacrifices, worship, or prayer. The skeptic might ask, &ldquo;Why would God never be mentioned when the Persian king receives over 175 references? Since God&rsquo;s sovereignty prevailed to save the Jews, why does He then not receive appropriate recognition?&rdquo;</p><p>It seems satisfying to respond that if God desired to be mentioned, He could just as sovereignly have moved the author to write of Him as He acted to save Israel. This situation seems to be more of a problem at the human level than the divine, because Esther is the classic illustration of God&rsquo;s providence as He, the unseen power, controls everything for His purpose. There are no miracles in Esther, but the preservation of Israel through providential control of every event and person reveals the omniscience and omnipotence of Jehovah. Whether He is named is not the issue. He is clearly the main character in the drama.</p><p>Second, &ldquo;Why were Mordecai and Esther so secular in their lifestyles?&rdquo; Esther (2:6&ndash;20) does not seem to have the zeal for holiness like Daniel (Dan. 1:8&ndash;20). Mordecai kept his and Esther&rsquo;s Jewish heritage secret, unlike Daniel (Dan. 6:5). The law of God was absent in contrast to Ezra<br />(Ezra 7:10). Nehemiah had a heart for Jerusalem that seemingly eluded the affections of Esther and Mordecai (Neh. 1:1&ndash;2:5).</p><p>The following observations help to shed some light on these issues. First, this short book does not record everything. Perhaps Mordecai and Esther actually possessed a deeper faith than becomes apparent here (cf. 4:16). Second, even godly Nehemiah did not mention his God when talking to King Artaxerxes (Neh. 2:1&ndash;8). Third, the Jewish festivals which provided structure for worship had been lost long before Esther, e.g., Passover (2 Kin. 23:22) and Pentecost (Neh. 8:17). Fourth, possibly the anti-Jewish letter written by the Samaritans to Ahasuerus several years earlier had frightened them (ca. 486 B.C.; Ezra 4:6). Fifth, the evil intentions of Haman did not just first surface when Mordecai refused to bow down (3:1, 2). Most likely they were long before shared by others which would have intimidated the Jewish population. Sixth, Esther did identify with her Jewish heritage at a most appropriate time (7:3, 4). And yet, the nagging question of why Esther and Mordecai did not seem to have the same kind of open devotion to God as did Daniel remains. Further, Nehemiah&rsquo;s prayer (Neh. 1:5&ndash;11, esp. v. 7) seems to indicate a spiritual lethargy among the Jewish exiles in Susa. So this issue must ultimately be resolved by God since He alone knows human hearts.</p><p><strong>Outline</strong><strong><br /></strong></p><p><strong>I.

"18","18","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>As with other books of the Bible, Job bears the name of the narrative&rsquo;s primary character. This name might have been derived from the Hebrew word for &ldquo;persecution,&rdquo; thus meaning &ldquo;persecuted one,&rdquo; or from an Arabic word meaning &ldquo;repent,&rdquo; thus bearing the name &ldquo;repentant one.&rdquo; The author recounts an era in the life of Job, in which he was tested and the character of God was revealed. New Testament writers directly quote Job two times (Rom. 11:35; 1 Cor. 3:19), plus Ezekiel 14:14, 20 and James 5:11 show Job was a real person.</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>The book does not name its author. Job is an unlikely candidate because the book&rsquo;s message rests on Job&rsquo;s ignorance of the events that occurred in heaven as they related to his ordeal. One Talmudic tradition suggests Moses as author since the land of Uz (1:1) was adjacent to Midian where Moses lived for 40 years, and he could have obtained a record of the story there. Solomon is also a good possibility due to the similarity of content with parts of the book of Ecclesiastes, as well as the fact that Solomon wrote the other Wisdom books (except Psalms, and he did author Pss. 72; 127). Though he lived long after Job, Solomon could have written about events that occurred long before his own time, in much the same manner as Moses was inspired to write about Adam and Eve. Elihu, Isaiah, Hezekiah, Jeremiah, and Ezra have also been suggested as possible authors, but without support.</p><p><br />The date of the book&rsquo;s writing may be much later than the events recorded therein. This conclusion is based on: 1) Job&rsquo;s age (42:16); 2) his life span of nearly 200 years (42:16) which fits the patriarchal period (Abraham lived 175 years; Gen. 25:7); 3) the social unit being the patriarchal family; 4) the Chaldeans who murdered Job&rsquo;s servants (1:17) were nomads and had not yet become city dwellers; 5) Job&rsquo;s wealth being measured in livestock rather than gold and silver (1:3; 42:12); 6) Job&rsquo;s priestly functions within his family (1:4, 5); and 7) a basic silence on matters such as the covenant of Abraham, Israel, the Exodus, and the law of Moses. The events of Job&rsquo;s odyssey appear to be patriarchal. Job, on the other hand, seemed to know about Adam (31:33) and the Noahic flood (12:15). These cultural/historical features found in the book appear to place the events chronologically at a time probably after Babel (Gen. 11:1&ndash;9) but before or contemporaneous with Abraham (Gen. 11:27ff.).</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>This book begins with a scene in heaven that explains everything to the reader (1:6&ndash;2:10). Job was suffering because God was contesting with Satan. Job never knew that, nor did any of his friends, so they all struggled to explain suffering from the perspective of their ignorance, until finally Job rested in nothing but faith in God&rsquo;s goodness and the hope of His redemption. That God vindicated his trust is the culminating message of the book. When there are no rational, or even theological, explanations for disaster and pain, trust God.</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>The occasion and events that follow Job&rsquo;s sufferings present significant questions for the faith of believers in all ages. Why does Job serve God? Job is heralded for his righteousness, being compared with Noah and Daniel (Ezek. 14:14&ndash;20), and for his spiritual endurance (James 5:11). Several other questions are alluded to throughout Job&rsquo;s ordeal, for instance, &ldquo;Why do the righteous suffer?&rdquo; Though an answer to that question may seem important, the book does not set forth such an answer. Job never knew the reasons for his suffering and neither did his friends. The righteous sufferer does not appear to learn about any of the heavenly court debates between God and Satan that precipitated his pain. In fact, when finally confronted by the Lord of the universe, Job put his hand over his mouth and said nothing. Job&rsquo;s silent response in no way trivialized the intense pain and loss he had endured. It merely underscored the importance of trusting God&rsquo;s purposes in the midst of suffering because suffering, like all other human experiences, is directed by perfect divine wisdom. In the end, the lesson learned was that one may never know the specific reason for his suffering; but one must trust in Sovereign God. That is the real answer to suffering.</p><p>The book treats two major themes and many other minor ones, both in the narrative framework of the prologue (chaps. 1, 2) and epilogue (42:7&ndash;17), and in the poetic account of Job&rsquo;s torment that lies in between (3:1&ndash;42:6). A key to understanding the first theme of the book is to notice the debate between God and Satan in heaven and how it connects with the 3 cycles of earthly debates between Job and his friends. God wanted to prove the character of believers to Satan and to all demons, angels, and people. The accusations are by Satan, who indicted God&rsquo;s claims of Job&rsquo;s righteousness as being untested, if not questionable. Satan accused the righteous of being faithful to God only for what they could get. Since Job did not serve God with pure motives, according to Satan, the whole relationship between him and God was a sham. Satan&rsquo;s confidence that he could turn Job against God came, no doubt, from the fact that he had led the holy angels to rebel with him. Satan thought he could destroy Job&rsquo;s faith in God by inflicting suffering on him, thus showing in principle that saving faith could be shattered. God released Satan to make his point if he could, but he failed, as true faith in God proved unbreakable. Even Job&rsquo;s wife told him to curse God (2:9), but he refused; his faith in God never failed (see 13:15). Satan tried to do the same to Peter (see Luke 22:31&ndash;34) and was unsuccessful in destroying Peter&rsquo;s faith (see John 21:15&ndash;19). When Satan has unleashed all that he can do to destroy saving faith, it stands firm (cf. Rom. 8:31&ndash;39). In the end, God proved His point with Satan that saving faith can&rsquo;t be destroyed no matter how much trouble a saint suffers, or how incomprehensible and undeserved it seems.</p><p>A second and related theme concerns proving the character of God to men. Does this sort of ordeal, in which God and His opponent Satan square off, with righteous Job as the test case, suggest that God is lacking in compassion and mercy toward Job? Not at all. As James says, &ldquo;You have heard of the perseverance of Job and have seen the end intended by the Lord&mdash;that the Lord is very compassionate and merciful&rdquo; (James 5:11). It was to prove the very opposite (42:10&ndash;17). Job says, &ldquo;Shall we indeed accept good from God, and shall we not accept adversity?&rdquo; (2:10). God&rsquo;s servant does not deny that he has suffered. He does deny that his suffering is a result of sin. Nor does he understand why he suffers. Job simply commits his ordeal with a devout heart of worship and humility (42:5, 6) to a sovereign and perfectly wise Creator&mdash;and that was what God wanted him to learn in this conflict with Satan. In the end, God flooded Job with more blessings than he had ever known.</p><p>The major reality of the book is the inscrutable mystery of innocent suffering. God ordains that His children walk in sorrow and pain, sometimes because of sin (cf. Num. 12:10&ndash;12), sometimes for chastening (cf. Heb. 12:5&ndash;12), sometimes for strengthening (cf. 2 Cor. 12:7&ndash;10; 1 Pet. 5:10), and sometimes to give opportunity to reveal His comfort and grace (2 Cor. 1:3&ndash;7). But there are times when the compelling issue in the suffering of the saints is unknowable because it is for a heavenly purpose that those on earth can&rsquo;t discern (cf. Ex. 4:11; John 9:1&ndash;3).</p><p>Job and his friends wanted to analyze the suffering and look for causes and solutions. Using all of their sound theology and insight into the situation, they searched for answers, but found only useless and wrong ideas, for which God rebuked them in the end (42:7). They couldn&rsquo;t know why Job suffered because what happened in heaven between God and Satan was unknown to them. They thought they knew all the answers, but they only intensified the dilemma by their insistent ignorance.</p><p>By spreading out some of the elements of this great theme, we can see the following truths in Job&rsquo;s experience:</p><p>1) There are matters going on in heaven with God that believers know nothing about; yet, they affect their lives;</p><p>2) Even the best effort at explaining the issues of life can be useless;</p><p>3) God&rsquo;s people do suffer. Bad things happen all the time to good people, so one cannot judge a person&rsquo;s spirituality by his painful circumstances or successes;</p><p>4) Even though God seems far away, perseverance in faith is a most noble virtue since God is good and one can safely leave his life in His hands;</p><p>5) The believer in the midst of suffering should not abandon God, but draw near to Him, so out of the fellowship can come the comfor&mdash;without the explanation; and</p><p>6) Suffering may be intense, but it will ultimately end for the righteous and God will bless abundantly.</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>The most critical interpretive challenge involves the book&rsquo;s primary message. Although often thought to be the pressing issue of the book, the question of why Job suffers is never revealed to Job, though the reader knows that it involves God&rsquo;s proving a point to Satan&mdash;a matter which completely transcends Job&rsquo;s ability to understand. James&rsquo; commentary on Job&rsquo;s case (5:11) draws the conclusion that it was to show God&rsquo;s compassion and mercy, but without apology, offers no explanation for Job&rsquo;s specific ordeal. Readers find themselves, putting their proverbial hands over their mouths, with no right to question or accuse the allwise and all-powerful Creator, who will do as He pleases, and in so doing, both proves His points in the spiritual realm to angels and demons and defines His compassion and mercy. Engaging in &ldquo;theodicy,&rdquo; i.e., man&rsquo;s attempt to defend God&rsquo;s involvement in calamity and suffering, is shown to be appropriate in these circumstances, though in the end, it is apparent that God does not need nor want a human advocate. The book of Job poignantly illustrates Deut. 29:29, &ldquo;The secret things belong to the LORD our God &hellip; &rdquo;</p><p>The nature of Job&rsquo;s guilt and innocence raises perplexing questions. God declared Job perfect, upright, fearing God, and shunning evil (Job 1:1). But Job&rsquo;s comforters raised a critical question based on Job&rsquo;s ordeal: Had not Job sinned? On several occasions Job readily admitted to having sinned (7:21; 13:26). But Job questioned the extent of his sin as compared to the severity of his suffering. God rebuked Job in the end for his demands to be vindicated of the comforters&rsquo; accusations (Job 38&ndash;41). But He also declared that what Job said was correct and what the comforters said was wrong (42:7).</p><p>Another challenge comes in keeping separate the pre-understandings that Job and his comforters brought to Job&rsquo;s ordeal. At the outset, all agreed that God punishes evil, rewards obedience, and no exceptions are possible. Job, due to his suffering innocently, was forced to conclude that exceptions are possible in that the righteous also suffer. He also observed that the wicked prosper. These are more than small exceptions to the rule, thus forcing Job to rethink his simple understanding about God&rsquo;s sovereign interaction with His people. The type of wisdom Job comes to embrace was not dependent merely on the promise of reward or punishment. The long, peevish, disputes between Job and his accusers were attempts to reconcile the perceived inequities of God&rsquo;s retribution in Job&rsquo;s experiences. Such an empirical method is dangerous. In the end, God offered no explanation to Job, but rather called all parties to a deeper level of trust in the Creator, who rules over a sin-confused world with power and authority directed by perfect wisdom and mercy.</p><p>Understanding this book requires 1) understanding the nature of wisdom, particularly the difference between man&rsquo;s wisdom and God&rsquo;s, and 2) admitting that Job and his friends lacked the divine wisdom to interpret Job&rsquo;s circumstances accurately, though his friends kept trying while Job learned to be content in God&rsquo;s sovereignty and mercy. The turning point or resolution for this matter is found in Job 28 where the character of divine wisdom is explained: divine wisdom is rare and priceless; man cannot hope to purchase it; and God possesses it all. We may not know what is going on in heaven or what God&rsquo;s purposes are, but we must trust Him. Because of this, the matter of believers suffering takes a back seat to the matter of divine wisdom.</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I. The Dilemma (1:1&ndash;2:13)</strong></p><p>A.

"19","19","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>The entire collection of Psalms is entitled &ldquo;Praises&rdquo; in the Hebrew text. Later, rabbis often designated it &ldquo;The Book of Praises.&rdquo; The Septuagint (LXX), the Greek translation of the OT, labeled it &ldquo;Psalms&rdquo; (cf. &ldquo;The book of Psalms&rdquo; in the NT: Luke 20:42; Acts 1:20). The Greek verb from which the noun &ldquo;psalms&rdquo; comes basically denotes the &ldquo;plucking or twanging of strings,&rdquo; so that an association with musical accompaniment is implied. The English title derives from the Greek term and its background. The Psalms constituted Israel&rsquo;s ancient, God-breathed (2 Tim. 3:16) &ldquo;hymnbook,&rdquo; which defined the proper spirit and content of worship.</p><p>There are 116 psalms that have superscriptions or &ldquo;titles.&rdquo; The Hebrew text includes these titles with the verses themselves. When the titles are surveyed individually and studied as a general phenomenon, there are significant indications that they were appended to their respective psalms shortly after composition and that they contain reliable information (cf. Luke 20:42).</p><p>These titles convey various kinds of information such as authorship, dedication, historical occasion, liturgical assignment to a worship director, liturgical instructions (e.g., what kind of song it is, whether it is to have a musical accompaniment, and what tune to use), plus other technical instructions of uncertain meaning due to their great antiquity. One very tiny, attached Hebrew preposition shows up in the majority of the Psalm titles. It may convey different relationships, e.g., &ldquo;of,&rdquo; &ldquo;from,&rdquo; &ldquo;by,&rdquo; &ldquo;to,&rdquo; &ldquo;for,&rdquo; &ldquo;in reference to,&rdquo; &ldquo;about.&rdquo; Sometimes it occurs more than once, even in short headings, usually supplying &ldquo;of,&rdquo; or &ldquo;by,&rdquo; person X &hellip; &ldquo;to,&rdquo; or &ldquo;for,&rdquo; person Y information. However, this little preposition most frequently indicates the authorship of a psalm, whether &ldquo;of&rdquo; David, the accomplished psalmist of Israel, or &ldquo;by&rdquo; Moses, Solomon, Asaph, or the sons of Korah.</p><p><strong>Authorship and Date</strong></p><p>From the divine perspective, the Psalter points to God as its author. Approaching authorship from the human side one can identify a collection of more than 7 composers. King David wrote at least 75 of the 150 psalms; the sons of Korah accounted for 10 (Pss. 42, 44&ndash;49,84, 85, 87); and Asaph contributed 12 (Pss. 50, 73&ndash;83). Other penmen included Solomon (Pss. 72, 127), Moses (Ps. 90), Heman (Ps. 88), and Ethan (Ps. 89). The remaining 48 psalms remain anonymous in their authorship, although Ezra is thought to be the author of some. The time range of the Psalms extends from Moses, ca. 1410 B.C. (Ps. 90), to the late sixth or early fifth century B.C. post-Exilic period (Ps. 126), which spans about 900 years of Jewish history.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>The backdrop for the Psalms is twofold: 1) the acts of God in creation and history, and 2) the history of Israel. Historically, the psalms range in time from the origin of life to the post-Exilic joys of the Jews liberated from Babylon. Thematically, the psalms cover a wide spectrum of topics, ranging from heavenly worship to earthly war. The collected psalms comprise the largest book in the Bible and the most frequently quoted OT book in the NT. Psalm 117 represents the middle chapter (out of 1,189) in the Bible. Psalm 119 is the largest chapter in the entire Bible. Through the ages, the psalms have retained their original primary purpose, i.e., to engender the proper praise and worship of God.</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>The basic theme of Psalms is living real life in the real world, where two dimensions operate simultaneously: 1) a horizontal or temporal reality, and 2) a vertical or transcendent reality. Without denying the pain of the earthly dimension, the people of God are to live joyfully and dependently on the Person and promises standing behind the heavenly/eternal dimension. All cycles of human troubles and triumphs provide occasions for expressing human complaints, confidence, prayers, or praise, to Israel&rsquo;s sovereign Lord.</p><p>In view of this, Psalms presents a broad array of theology, practically couched in day-today reality. The sinfulness of man is documented concretely, not only through the behavioral patterns of the wicked, but also by the periodic stumblings of believers. The sovereignty of God is everywhere recognized, but not at the expense of genuine human responsibility. Life often seems to be out of control, and yet all events and situations are understood in the light of divine providence as being right on course according to God&rsquo;s timetable. Assuring glimpses of a future &rdquo;God&rsquo;s day&rdquo; bolsters the call for perseverance to the end. This book of praise manifests a very practical theology.</p><p>A commonly misunderstood phenomenon in Psalms is the association that often develops between the &ldquo;one&rdquo; (the psalmist) and the &ldquo;many&rdquo; (the theocratic people). Virtually all of the cases of this occur in the psalms of King David. There was an inseparable relationship between the mediatorial ruler and his people; as life went for the king, so it went for the people. Furthermore, at times this union accounted for the psalmist&rsquo;s apparent connection with Christ in the messianic psalms (or messianic portions of certain psalms). The so-called imprecatory (curse pronouncing) psalms may be better understood with this perspective. As God&rsquo;s mediatorial representative on earth, David prayed for judgment on his enemies, since these enemies were not only hurting him, but were primarily hurting God&rsquo;s people. Ultimately, they challenged the King of Kings, the God of Israel.</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>It is helpful to recognize certain recurring genres or literary types in the Psalter. Some of the most obvious are: 1) the wisdom type with instructions for right living; 2) lamentation patterns which deal with the pangs of life (usually arising from enemies without); 3) penitential psalms (mostly dealing with the &ldquo;enemy&rdquo; within, i.e., sin); 4) kingship emphases (universal or mediatorial; theocratic and/or messianic rule); and 5) thanksgiving psalms. A combination of style and subject matter help to identify such types when they appear.</p><p>The comprehensive literary characteristic of the psalms is that all of them are poetry par excellence. Unlike most English poetry, which is based on rhyme and meter, Hebrew poetry is essentially characterized by logical parallelisms. Some of the most important kinds of parallelisms are: 1) synonymous (the thought of the first line is restated with similar concepts in the second line, e.g., Ps. 2:1); 2) antithetic (the thought of the second line is contrasted with the first, e.g., Ps. 1:6); 3) climactic (the second and any subsequent lines pick up a crucial word, phrase, or concept and advance it in a stair-step fashion, e.g., Ps. 29:1, 2); and 4) chiastic or introverted (the logical units are developed in an A &hellip; B&hellip;B&rsquo; &hellip; A&rsquo; &hellip; pattern, e.g., Ps. 1:2).</p><p>On a larger scale, some psalms in their development from the first to the last verse employ an acrostic or alphabetical arrangement. Psalms 9, 10, 25, 34, 37, 111, 112, 119, and 145 are recognized as either complete or incomplete acrostics. In the Hebrew text, the first letter of the first word of every verse begins with a different Hebrew consonant, which advances in alphabetical order until the 22 consonants are exhausted. Such a literary vehicle undoubtedly aided in the memorization of the content and served to indicate that its particular subject matter had been covered from &ldquo;A to Z.&rdquo; Psalm 119 stands out as the most complete example of this device, since the first letter of each of its 22, 8-verse stanzas moves completely through the Hebrew alphabet.</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p>The 150 canonical psalms were organized quite early into 5 &ldquo;books.&rdquo; Each of these books ends with a doxology (Pss. 41:13; 72:18&ndash;20; 89:52; 106:48; 150:6). Jewish tradition appealed to the number 5 and alleged that these divisions echoed the Pentateuch, i.e., the 5 books of Moses. It is true that there are clusters of psalms, such as 1) those drawn together by an association with an individual or group (e.g., &ldquo;The sons of Korah,&rdquo; Pss. 42&ndash;49; Asaph, Pss. 73&ndash;83), 2) those dedicated to a particular function (e.g., &ldquo;Songs of ascents,&rdquo; Pss. 120&ndash;134), or 3)<br />those devoted explicitly to praise worship (Pss. 146&ndash;150). But no one configuration key unlocks the &ldquo;mystery&rdquo; as to the organizing theme of this 5-book arrangement. Thus, there is no identifiable thematic structure to the entire collection of psalms.</p>"
"20","20","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>The title in the Hebrew Bible is &ldquo;The Proverbs of Solomon&ldquo; (1:1), as also in the Greek Septuagint (LXX). Proverbs pulls together the most important 513 of the over 3,000 proverbs pondered by Solomon (1 Kin. 4:32; Eccl. 12:9), along with some proverbs of others whom Solomon likely influenced. The word &ldquo;proverb&rdquo; means &ldquo;to be like,&rdquo; thus Proverbs is a book of comparisons between common, concrete images and life&rsquo;s most profound truths. Proverbs are simple, moral statements (or illustrations) that highlight and teach fundamental realities about life. Solomon sought God&rsquo;s wisdom (2 Chr. 1:8&ndash;12) and offered &ldquo;pithy sayings&rdquo; designed to make men contemplate 1) the fear of God and 2) living by His wisdom (1:7; 9:10). The sum of this wisdom is personified in the Lord Jesus Christ (1 Cor. 1:30).</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>The phrase &ldquo;Proverbs of Solomon&rdquo; is more a title than an absolute statement of authorship (1:1). While King Solomon, who ruled Israel from 971&ndash;931 B.C. and was granted great wisdom by God (see 1 Kin. 4:29&ndash;34), is the author of the didactic section (chaps. 1&ndash;9) and the proverbs of 10:1&ndash;22:16, he is likely only the compiler of the &ldquo;sayings of the wise&rdquo; in 22:17&ndash;24:34, which are of an uncertain date before Solomon&rsquo;s reign. The collection in chaps. 25&ndash;29 was originally composed by Solomon (25:1) but copied and included later by Judah&rsquo;s king Hezekiah (ca. 715&ndash;686 B.C.). Chapter 30 reflects the words of Agur and chap. 31 the words of Lemuel, who perhaps was Solomon. Proverbs was not assembled in its final form until Hezekiah&rsquo;s day or after. Solomon authored his proverbs before his heart was turned away from God (1 Kin. 11:1&ndash;11), since the book reveals a godly perspective and is addressed to the &ldquo;naive&rdquo; and &ldquo;young&rdquo; who need to learn the fear of God. Solomon also wrote Psalms 72 and 127, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Solomon. See Introduction: Author and Date for Ecclesiastes and Song of Solomon.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>The book reflects a 3-fold setting as: 1) general wisdom literature; 2) insights from the royal court; and 3) instruction offered in the tender relationship of a father and mother with their children, all designed to produce meditation on God. Since Proverbs is Wisdom literature, by nature it is sometimes difficult to understand (1:6). Wisdom literature is part of the whole of OT truth; the Priest gave the <em>Law</em>, the Prophet gave a <em>Word</em> from the Lord, and the Sage (or wise man) gave his wise <em>Counsel</em> (Jer. 18:18; Ezek. 7:26). In Proverbs, Solomon the Sage gives insight into the &ldquo;knotty&rdquo; issues of life (1:6) which are not directly addressed in the Law or the Prophets. Though it is practical, Proverbs is not superficial or external because it contains moral and ethical elements stressing upright living which flow out of a right relationship with God. In 4:1&ndash;4, Solomon connected 3 generations as he entrusted to his son Rehoboam what he learned at the feet of David and Bathsheba. Proverbs is both a pattern for the tender impartation of truth from generation to generation, as well as a vast resource for the content of the truth to be imparted. Proverbs contains the principles and applications of Scripture which the godly characters of the Bible illustrate in their lives.</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>Solomon came to the throne with great promise, privilege, and opportunity. God had granted his request for understanding (1 Kin. 3:9&ndash;12; 1 Chr. 1:10, 11), and his wisdom exceeded all others (1 Kin. 4:29&ndash;31). However, the shocking reality is that he failed to live out the truth that he knew and even taught his son Rehoboam (1 Kin. 11:1, 4, 6, 7&ndash;11), who subsequently rejected his father&rsquo;s teaching (1 Kin. 12:6&ndash;11).</p><p>Proverbs contains a gold mine of biblical theology, reflecting themes of Scripture brought to the level of practical righteousness (1:3), by addressing man&rsquo;s ethical choices, calling into question how he thinks, lives, and manages his daily life in light of divine truth. More specifically, Proverbs calls man to live as the Creator intended him to live when He made man (Ps. 90:1, 2, 12).</p><p>The recurring promise of Proverbs is that generally the wise (the righteous who obey God) live longer (9:11), prosper (2:20&ndash;22), experience joy (3:13&ndash;18) and the goodness of God temporally (12:21), while fools suffer shame (3:35) and death (10:21). On the other hand, it must be remembered that this general principle is balanced by the reality that the wicked sometimes prosper (Ps. 73:3, 12), though only temporarily (Ps. 73:17&ndash;19). Job illustrates that there are occasions when the godly wise are struck with disaster and suffering.</p><p>There are a number of important themes addressed in Proverbs, which are offered in random order and address different topics, so that it is helpful to study the proverbs thematically as illustrated.</p><p><strong>I. Man&rsquo;s Relationship to God</strong></p><p>A. His Trust Prov. 22:19</p><p>B. His Humility Prov. 3:34</p><p>C. His Fear of God Prov. 1:7</p><p>D. His Righteousness Prov. 10:25</p><p>E.

His Pride Prov. 27:1</p><p>I. His Anger Prov. 29:11</p><p>J. His Laziness Prov. 13:4</p><p><strong>III. Man&rsquo;s Relationship to Others</strong></p><p>A. His Love Prov. 8:17</p><p>B. His Friends Prov. 17:17</p><p>C. His Enemies Prov. 19:27</p><p>D. His Truthfulness Prov. 23:23</p><p>E. His Gossip Prov. 20:19</p><p>F. As a Father Prov. 20:7; 31:2-9</p><p>G. As a Mother Prov. 31:10-31</p><p>H. As Children Prov. 3:1-3</p><p>I. In Educating Children Prov. 4:1-4</p><p>J. In Disciplining Children Prov. 22:6</p><p>The two major themes which are interwoven and overlapping throughout Proverbs are wisdom and folly. Wisdom, which includes knowledge, understanding, instruction, discretion, and obedience, is built on the fear of the Lord and the Word of God. Folly is everything opposite to wisdom.</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>The first challenge is the generally elusive nature of Wisdom literature itself. Like the parables, the intended truths are often veiled from understanding if given only a cursory glance, and thus must be pondered in the heart (1:6; 2:1&ndash;4; 4:4&ndash;9).</p><p>Another challenge is the extensive use of parallelism, which is the placing of truths side by side so that the second line expands, completes, defines, emphasizes, or reaches the logical conclusion, the ultimate end, or, in some cases, the contrasting point of view. Often the actual parallel is only implied. For example, 12:13 contains an unstated, but clearly implied parallel, in that the righteous one comes through trouble because of his virtuous speech (cf. 28:7). In interpreting the Proverbs, one must: 1) determine the parallelism and often complete what is assumed and not stated by the author; 2) identify the figures of speech and rephrase the thought without those figures; 3) summarize the lesson or principle of the proverb in a few words; 4) describe the behavior that is taught; and 5) find examples inside Scripture.</p><p>Challenges are also found in the various contexts of Proverbs, all of which affect interpretation and understanding. First, there is the setting in which they were spoken; this is largely the context of the young men in the royal court of the king. Second, there is the setting of the book as a whole and how its teachings are to be understood in light of the rest of Scripture. For example, there is much to be gained by comparing the wisdom Solomon taught with the wisdom Christ personified. Third, there is the historical context in which the principles and truths draw on illustrations from their own day.</p><p>A final area of challenge comes in understanding that proverbs are divine guidelines and wise observations, i.e., teaching underlying principles (24:3, 4) which are not always inflexible laws or absolute promises. These expressions of general truth (cf. 10:27; 22:4) generally do have &ldquo;exceptions,&rdquo; due to the uncertainty of life and unpredictable behavior of fallen men. God does not guarantee uniform outcome or application for each proverb, but in studying them and applying them, one comes to contemplate the mind of God, His character, His attributes, His works, and His blessings. All of the treasures of wisdom and knowledge expressed in Proverbs are hidden in Christ (Col. 2:3).</p><p><strong>Outline<br /></strong></p><p><strong>I. Prologue (1:1&ndash;7)</strong></p><p>A.

"21","21","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>The English title, Ecclesiastes, comes from the Greek and Latin translations of Solomon&rsquo;s book. The LXX, the Greek translation of the OT, used the Greek term <em>ekklÄ“siastÄ“s</em> for its title. It means &ldquo;preacher,&rdquo; derived from the word <em>ekklÄ“sia</em>, translated &ldquo;assembly&rdquo; or &ldquo;congregation&rdquo; in the NT. Both the Greek and Latin versions derive their titles from the Hebrew title, <em>Qoheleth</em>, which means &ldquo;one who calls or gathers&rdquo; the people. It refers to the one who addresses the assembly; hence, the preacher (cf. 1:1, 2, 12; 7:27; 12:8&ndash;10). Along with Ruth, Song of Solomon, Esther, and Lamentations, Ecclesiastes stands with the OT books of the Megilloth, or &ldquo;five scrolls.&rdquo; Later rabbis read these books in the synagogue on 5 special occasions during the year&mdash;Ecclesiastes being read on Pentecost.</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>The autobiographical profile of the book&rsquo;s writer unmistakably points to Solomon. Evidence abounds such as: 1) the titles fit Solomon, &ldquo;son of David, king in Jerusalem&rdquo; (1:1) and &ldquo;king over Israel in Jerusalem&rdquo; (1:12); 2) the author&rsquo;s moral odyssey chronicles Solomon&rsquo;s life (1 Kin. 2&ndash;11); and 3) the role of one who &ldquo;taught the people knowledge&rdquo; and wrote &ldquo;many proverbs&rdquo; (12:9) corresponds to his life. All point to Solomon, the son of David, as the author.</p><p>Once Solomon is accepted as the author, the date and occasion become clear. Solomon was writing, probably in his latter years (no later than ca. 931 B.C.), primarily to warn the young people of his kingdom, without omitting others. He warned them to avoid walking through life on the path of human wisdom; he exhorted them to live by the revealed wisdom of God (12:9&ndash;14).</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>Solomon&rsquo;s reputation for possessing extraordinary wisdom fits the Ecclesiastes profile. David recognized his son&rsquo;s wisdom (1 Kin. 2:6, 9) before God gave Solomon an additional measure. After he received a &ldquo;wise and understanding heart&rdquo; from the Lord (1 Kin. 3:7&ndash;12), Solomon gained renown for being exceedingly wise by rendering insightful decisions (1 Kin.3:16&ndash;28), a reputation that attracted &ldquo;all the kings of the earth&rdquo; to his courts (1 Kin. 4:34). In addition, he composed songs and proverbs (1 Kin. 4:32; cf. 12:9), activity befitting only the ablest of sages. Solomon&rsquo;s wisdom, like Job&rsquo;s wealth, surpassed the wisdom &ldquo;of all the people of the east&rdquo; (1 Kin. 4:30; Job 1:3).</p><p>The book is applicable to all who would listen and benefit, not so much from Solomon&rsquo;s experiences, but from the principles he drew as a result. Its aim is to answer some of life&rsquo;s most challenging questions, particularly where they seem contrary to Solomon&rsquo;s expectations. This has led some unwisely to take the view that Ecclesiastes is a book of skepticism. But in spite of amazingly unwise behavior and thinking, Solomon never let go of his faith in God (12:13, 14).</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>As is true with most biblical Wisdom literature, little historical narrative occurs in Ecclesiastes, apart from Solomon&rsquo;s own personal pilgrimage. The kingly sage studied life with high expectations but repeatedly bemoaned its shortcomings, which he acknowledged were due to the curse (Gen. 3:14&ndash;19). Ecclesiastes represents the painful autobiography of Solomon who, for much of his life, squandered God&rsquo;s blessings on his own personal pleasure rather than God&rsquo;s glory. He wrote to warn subsequent generations not to make the same tragic error, in much the same manner as Paul wrote to the Corinthians (cf. 1 Cor. 1:18&ndash;31; 2:13&ndash;16).</p><p>The key word is &ldquo;vanity,&rdquo; which expresses the futile attempt to be satisfied apart from God. This word is used 37 times expressing the many things hard to understand about life. All earthly goals and ambitions when pursued as ends in themselves produce only emptiness. Paul was probably echoing Solomon&rsquo;s dissatisfaction when he wrote, &ldquo; &hellip; the creation was subjected to futility&rdquo; (Solomon&rsquo;s &ldquo;vanity&rdquo;; Rom. 8:19&ndash;21). Solomon&rsquo;s experience with the effects of the curse (see Gen. 3:17&ndash;19) led him to view life as &ldquo;chasing after the wind.&rdquo;</p><p>Solomon asked, &ldquo;What profit has a man from all his labor &hellip;?&rdquo; (1:3), a question he repeated in 2:24 and 3:9. The wise king gave over a considerable portion of the book to addressing this dilemma. The impossibility of discovering both the inner workings of God&rsquo;s creation and the personal providence of God in Solomon&rsquo;s life were also deeply troubling to the king, as they were to Job. But the reality of judgment for all, despite many unknowns, emerged as the great certainty. In light of this judgment by God, the only fulfilled life is one lived in proper recognition of God and service to Him. Any other kind of life is frustrating and pointless.</p><p>A proper balance of the prominent &ldquo;enjoy life&rdquo; theme with that of &ldquo;divine judgment&rdquo; tethers the reader to Solomon&rsquo;s God with the sure chord of faith. For a time, Solomon suffered from the imbalance of trying to enjoy life without regard for the fear of Yahweh&rsquo;s judgment holding him on the path of obedience. In the end, he came to grasp the importance of obedience. The tragic results of Solomon&rsquo;s personal experience, coupled with the insight of extraordinary wisdom, make Ecclesiastes a book from which all believers can be warned and grow in their faith (cf. 2:1&ndash;26). This book shows that if one perceives each day of existence, labor, and basic provision as a gift from God, and accepts whatever God gives, then that person lives an abundant life (cf. John 10:10). However, one who looks to be satisfied apart from God will live with futility regardless of his accumulations.</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>The author&rsquo;s declaration that &ldquo;all is vanity&rdquo; envelops the primary message of the book (cf. 1:2; 12:8). The word translated &ldquo;vanity&rdquo; is used in at least 3 ways throughout the book. In each case, it looks at the nature of man&rsquo;s activity &ldquo;under the sun&rdquo; as: 1)&rdquo;fleeting,&rdquo; which has in view<br />the vapor-like (cf. James 4:14) or transitory nature of life; 2)&rdquo;futile&rdquo; or &ldquo;meaningless,&rdquo; which focuses on the cursed condition of the universe and the debilitating effects it has on man&rsquo;s earthly experience; or 3) &ldquo;incomprehensible&rdquo; or &ldquo;enigmatic,&rdquo; which gives consideration to life&rsquo;s unanswerable questions. Solomon draws upon all 3 meanings in Ecclesiastes.</p><p>While the context in each case will determine which meaning Solomon is focusing upon, the most recurring meaning of vanity is &ldquo;incomprehensible&rdquo; or &ldquo;unknowable,&rdquo; referring to the mysteries of God&rsquo;s purposes. Solomon&rsquo;s conclusion to &ldquo;fear God and keep His commandments&rdquo; (12:13, 14) is more than the book&rsquo;s summary; it is the only hope of the good life and the only reasonable response of faith and obedience to sovereign God. He precisely works out all activities under the sun, each in its time according to His perfect plan, but also discloses only as much as His perfect wisdom dictates and holds all men accountable. Those who refuse to take God and His Word seriously are doomed to lives of the severest vanity.</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p>The book chronicles Solomon&rsquo;s investigations and conclusions regarding man&rsquo;s lifework, which combine all of his activity and its potential outcomes including limited satisfaction. The role of wisdom in experiencing success surfaces repeatedly, particularly when Solomon must acknowledge that God has not revealed all of the details. This leads Solomon to the conclusion that the primary issues of life after the Edenic fall involve divine blessings to be enjoyed and the divine judgment for which all must prepare.</p><p><strong>I.

"22","22","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>The Greek Septuagint (LXX) and Latin Vulgate (Vg.) versions follow the Hebrew (Masoretic Text) with literal translations of the first two words in 1:1&mdash;&rdquo;Song of Songs.&rdquo; Several English versions read &ldquo;The Song of Solomon,&rdquo; thus giving the fuller sense of 1:1. The superlative, &ldquo;Song of Songs&rdquo; (cf. &ldquo;Holy of Holies&rdquo; in Ex. 26:33, 34 and &ldquo;King of Kings&rdquo; in Rev. 19:16), indicates that this song is the best among Solomon&rsquo;s 1,005 musical works (1 Kin. 4:32). The word translated &ldquo;song&rdquo; frequently refers to music that honors the Lord (cf. 1 Chr. 6:31, 32; Pss. 33:3; 40:3; 144:9).</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>Solomon, who reigned over the united kingdom 40 years (971&ndash;931 B.C.), appears 7 times by name in this book (1:1, 5; 3:7, 9, 11; 8:11, 12). In view of his writing skills, musical giftedness (1 Kin. 4:32), and the authorial, not dedicatory, sense of 1:1, this piece of Scripture could have been penned at any time during Solomon&rsquo;s reign. Since cities to the north and to the south are spoken of in Solomon&rsquo;s descriptions and travels, both the period depicted and the time of actual writing point to the united kingdom before it divided after Solomon&rsquo;s reign ended. Knowing that this portion of Scripture comprises one song by one author, it is best taken as a unified piece of poetic, Wisdom literature rather than a series of love poems without a common theme or author.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>Two people dominate this true-life, dramatic love song. Solomon, whose kingship is mentioned 5 times (1:4, 12; 3:9, 11; 7:5), appears as &ldquo;the beloved.&rdquo; The Shulamite maiden (6:13) remains obscure; most likely she was a resident of Shunem, 3 mi. N of Jezreel in lower Galilee. Some suggest she is Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter (1 Kin. 3:1), although the Song provides no evidence for this conclusion. Others favor Abishag, the Shunammite who cared for King David (1 Kin. 1:1&ndash;4, 15). An unknown maiden from Shunem, whose family had possibly beenemployed by Solomon (8:11), seems most reasonable. She would have been Solomon&rsquo;s first wife (Eccl. 9:9), before he sinned by adding 699 other wives and 300 concubines (1 Kin. 11:3).</p><p>Minor roles feature several different groups in this book. First, note the not infrequent commentary by &ldquo;the daughters of Jerusalem&rdquo; (1:5; 2:7; 3:5; 5:8, 16; 8:4), who might be part of Solomon&rsquo;s household staff (cf. 3:10). Second, Solomon&rsquo;s friends join in at 3:6&ndash;11; and third, so do the Shulamite&rsquo;s brothers (8:8, 9). The affirmation of 5:1b would most likely be God&rsquo;s blessing on the couple&rsquo;s union. One can follow the narrative by noticing the suggested parts as indicated in headings throughout the song. Where possible variations are reasonable, they will be recognized in the study notes.</p><p>The setting combines both rural and urban scenes. Portions take place in the hill country north of Jerusalem, where the Shulamite lived (6:13) and where Solomon enjoyed prominence as a vinegrower and shepherd (Eccl. 2:4&ndash;7). The city section includes the wedding and time afterward at Solomon&rsquo;s abode in Jerusalem (3:6&ndash;7:13).</p><p>The first spring appears in 2:11&ndash;13 and the second in 7:12. Assuming a chronology without gaps, the Song of Solomon took place over a period of time at least one year in length, but probably no longer than two years.</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>All 117 verses in Solomon&rsquo;s Song have been recognized by the Jews as a part of their sacred writings. Along with Ruth, Esther, Ecclesiastes, and Lamentations, it is included among the OT books of the Megilloth, or &ldquo;five scrolls.&rdquo; The Jews read this song at Passover, calling it &ldquo;the Holy of Holies.&rdquo; Surprisingly, God is not mentioned explicitly except possibly in 8:6. No formal theological themes emerge. The NT never quotes Solomon&rsquo;s Song directly (nor Esther, Obadiah, and Nahum).</p><p>In contrast to the two distorted extremes of ascetic abstinence and lustful perversion outside of marriage, Solomon&rsquo;s ancient love song exalts the purity of marital affection and romance. It parallels and enhances other portions of Scripture which portray God&rsquo;s plan for marriage, including the beauty and sanctity of sexual intimacy between husband and wife. The Song rightfully stands alongside other classic Scripture passages which expand on this theme, e.g., Gen. 2:24; Ps. 45; Prov. 5:15&ndash;23; 1 Cor. 7:1&ndash;5; 13:1&ndash;8; Eph. 5:18&ndash;33; Col. 3:18, 19; and 1 Pet. 3:1&ndash;7. Hebrews 13:4 captures the heart of this song, &ldquo;Marriage is honorable among all, and the bed undefiled; but fornicators and adulterers God will judge.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>The Song has suffered strained interpretations over the centuries by those who use the &ldquo;allegorical&rdquo; method of interpretation, claiming that this song has no actual historical basis, but rather that it depicts God&rsquo;s love for Israel and/or Christ&rsquo;s love for the church. The misleading idea from hymnology that Christ is the rose of Sharon and the lily of the valleys results from this method (2:1). The &ldquo;typological&rdquo; variation admits the historical reality, but concludes that it ultimately pictures Christ&rsquo;s bridegroom love for His bride the church.</p><p>A more satisfying way to approach Solomon&rsquo;s Song is to take it at face value and interpret it in the normal historical sense, understanding the frequent use of poetic imagery to depict reality. To do so understands that Solomon recounts 1) his own days of courtship, 2) the early days of his first marriage, followed by 3) the maturing of this royal couple through the good and bad days of life. The Song of Solomon expands on the ancient marriage instructions of Gen. 2:24, thus providing spiritual music for a lifetime of marital harmony. It is given by God to demonstrate His intention for the romance and loveliness of marriage, the most precious of human relations and &ldquo;the grace of life&rdquo; (1 Pet. 3:7).</p><p><strong>Outline<br /></strong></p><p><strong>I.

"23","23","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>The book derives its title from the author, whose name means &ldquo;The LORD is salvation,&rdquo; and is similar to the names Joshua, Elisha, and Jesus. Isaiah is quoted directly in the NT over 65 times, far more than any other OT prophet, and mentioned by name over 20 times.</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>Isaiah, the son of Amoz, ministered in and around Jerusalem as a prophet to Judah during the reigns of 4 kings of Judah: Uzziah (called &ldquo;Azariah&rdquo; in 2 Kings), Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah (1:1), from ca. 739&ndash;686 B.C. He evidently came from a family of some rank, because he had easy access to the king (7:3) and intimacy with a priest (8:2). He was married and had two sons who bore symbolic names: &ldquo;Shear- jashub&rdquo; (&ldquo;a remnant shall return,&rdquo; 7:3) and &ldquo;Maher-shalalhash-baz&rdquo; (&ldquo;hasting to the spoil, hurrying to the prey,&rdquo; 8:3). When called by God to prophesy, in the year of King Uzziah&rsquo;s death (ca. 739 B.C.), he responded with a cheerful readiness, though he knew from the beginning that his ministry would be one of fruitless warning and exhortation (6:9&ndash;13). Having been reared in Jerusalem, he was an appropriate choice as a<br />political and religious counselor to the nation.</p><p>Isaiah was a contemporary of Hosea and Micah. His writing style has no rival in its versatility of expression, brilliance of imagery, and richness of vocabulary. The early church father Jerome likened him to Demosthenes, the legendary Greek orator. His writing features a range of 2,186 different words, compared to 1,535 in Ezekiel, 1,653 in Jeremiah, and 2,170 in the Psalms. Second Chronicles 32:32 records that he wrote a biography of King Hezekiah also. The prophet lived until at least 681 B.C. when he penned the account of Sennacherib&rsquo;s death (cf. 37:38). Tradition has it that he met his death under King Manasseh (ca. 695&ndash;642 B.C.) by being cut in two with a wooden saw (cf. Heb. 11:37).</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>During Uzziah&rsquo;s prosperous 52 year reign (ca. 790&ndash;739 B.C.), Judah developed into a strong commercial and military state with a port for commerce on the Red Sea and the construction of walls, towers, and fortifications (2 Chr. 26:3&ndash;5,8&ndash;10,13&ndash;15). Yet the period witnessed a decline in Judah&rsquo;s spiritual status. Uzziah&rsquo;s downfall resulted from his attempt to assume the privileges of a priest and burn incense on the altar (2 Kin. 15:3,4; 2 Chr. 26:16&ndash;19). He was judged with leprosy, from which he never recovered (2 Kin. 15:5; 2 Chr 26:20,21).</p><p>His son Jotham (ca. 750&ndash;731 B.C.) had to take over the duties of king before his father&rsquo;s death. Assyria began to emerge as a new international power under Tiglath-Pileser (ca. 745&ndash;727 B.C.) while Jotham was king (2 Kin. 15:19). Judah also began to incur opposition from Israel and Syria to her north during his reign (2 Kin. 15:37). Jotham was a builder and a fighter like his father, but spiritual corruption still existed in the Land (2 Kin. 15:34,35; 2 Chr. 27:1,2).</p><p>Ahaz was 25 when he began to reign in Judah and he reigned until age 41 (2 Chr. 28:1,8; ca. 735&ndash;715 B.C.). Israel and Syria formed an alliance to combat the rising Assyrian threat from the E, but Ahaz refused to bring Judah into the alliance (2 Kin. 16:5; Is. 7:6). For this, the<br />northern neighbors threatened to dethrone him, and war resulted (734 B.C.). In panic, Ahaz sent to the Assyrian king for help (2 Kin. 16:7) and the Assyrian king gladly responded, sacking Gaza, carrying all of Galilee and Gilead into captivity, and finally capturing Damascus (732<br />B.C.). Ahaz&rsquo;s alliance with Assyria led to his introduction of a heathen altar, which he set up in Solomon&rsquo;s temple (2 Kin. 16:10&ndash;16; 2 Chr. 28:3). During his reign (722 B.C.), Assyria captured Samaria, capital of the northern kingdom, and carried many of Israel&rsquo;s most capable people into captivity (2 Kin. 17:6,24).</p><p>Hezekiah began his reign over Judah in 715 B.C. and continued for 29 years to ca. 686 B.C. (2 Kin. 18:1,2). Reformation was a priority when he became king (2 Kin. 18:4,22; 2 Chr. 30:1). The threat of an Assyrian invasion forced Judah to promise heavy tribute to that eastern power. In 701 B.C. Hezekiah became very ill with a life-threatening disease, but he prayed and God graciously extended his life for 15 years (2 Kin. 20; Is. 38) until 686 B.C. The ruler of Babylon used the opportunity of his illness and recovery to send congratulations to him, probably seeking to form an alliance with Judah against Assyria at the same time (2 Kin. 20:12 ff.; Is. 39). When Assyria became weak through internal strife, Hezekiah refused to pay any further tribute to that power (2 Kin. 18:7). So in 701 B.C. Sennacherib, the Assyrian king, invaded the coastal areas of Israel, marching toward Egypt on Israel&rsquo;s southern flank. In the process he overran many Judean towns, looting and carrying many people back to Assyria. While besieging Lachish, he sent a contingent of forces to besiege Jerusalem (2 Kin 18:17&ndash;19:8; Is. 36:2&ndash;37:8). The side-expedition failed, however, so in a second attempt he sent messengers to Jerusalem demanding an immediate surrender of the city (2 Kin. 19:9ff.; Is. 37:9ff.). With Isaiah&rsquo;s encouragement, Hezekiah refused to surrender, and when Sennacherib&rsquo;s army fell prey to a sudden disaster, he returned to Nineveh and never threatened Judah again.</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>Isaiah prophesied during the period of the divided kingdom, directing the major thrust of his message to the southern kingdom of Judah. He condemned the empty ritualism of his day (e.g., 1:10&ndash;15) and the idolatry into which so many of the people had fallen (e.g., 40:18&ndash;20).<br />He foresaw the coming Babylonian captivity of Judah because of this departure from the Lord (39:6,7).</p><p>Fulfillment of some of his prophesies in his own lifetime provided his credentials for the prophetic office. Sennacherib&rsquo;s effort to take Jerusalem failed, just as Isaiah had said it would (37:6,7,36&ndash;38). The Lord healed Hezekiah&rsquo;s critical illness, as Isaiah had predicted (38:5; 2 Kin. 20:7). Long before Cyrus, king of Persia appeared on the scene, Isaiah named him as Judah&rsquo;s deliverer from the Babylonian captivity (44:28; 45:1). Fulfillment of his prophecies of Christ&rsquo;s first coming have given Isaiah further vindication (e.g., 7:14). The pattern of literal fulfillment of his already-fulfilled prophecies gives assurance that prophecies of Christ&rsquo;s second coming will also see literal fulfillment.</p><p>More than any other prophet, Isaiah provides data on the future day of the Lord and the time following. He details numerous aspects of Israel&rsquo;s future kingdom on earth not found elsewhere in the OT or NT, including changes in nature, the animal world, Jerusalem&rsquo;s status among the nations, the Suffering Servant&rsquo;s leadership, and others.</p><p>Through a literary device called &ldquo;prophetic foreshortening,&rdquo; Isaiah predicted future events without delineating exact sequences of the events or time intervals separating them. For example, nothing in Isaiah reveals the extended period separating the two comings of the Messiah. Also, he does not provide as clear a distinction between the future temporal kingdom and the eternal kingdom as John does in Revelation 20:1&ndash;10; 21:1&ndash;22:5. In God&rsquo;s program of progressive revelation, details of these relationships awaited a prophetic spokesman of a later time.</p><p>Also known as the &ldquo;evangelical Prophet,&rdquo; Isaiah spoke much about the grace of God toward Israel, particularly in his last 27 chapters. The centerpiece is Isaiah&rsquo;s unrivaled chap. 53, portraying Christ as the slain Lamb of God.</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>Interpretive challenges in a long and significant book such as Isaiah are numerous. The most critical of them focuses on whether Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecies will receive literal fulfillment or not, and on whether the Lord, in His program, has abandoned national Israel and permanently replaced the nation with the church, so that there is no future for national Israel. On the latter issue, numerous portions of Isaiah support the position that God has not replaced ethnic Israel with an alleged &ldquo;new Israel.&rdquo; Isaiah has too much to say about God&rsquo;s faithfulness to Israel, that He would not reject the people whom He has created and chosen (43:1). The nation is on the palms of His hands, and Jerusalem&rsquo;s walls are ever before His eyes (49:16). He is bound by His own Word to fulfill the promises He has made to bring them back to Himself and bless them in that future day (55:10&ndash;12).</p><p>On the former issue, literal fulfillment of many of Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecies has already occurred, as illustrated in Introduction: Historical and Theological Themes. To contend that those yet unfulfilled will see non-literal fulfillment is biblically groundless. This fact disqualifies the case<br />for proposing that the church receives some of the promises made originally to Israel. The kingdom promised to David belongs to Israel, not the church. The future exaltation of Jerusalem will be on earth, not in heaven. Christ will reign personally on this earth as we know it, as well as in the new heavens and new earth (Rev. 22:1,3).</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I.

"24","24","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>This book gains its title from the human author, who begins with &ldquo;the words of Jeremiah&hellip; &rdquo; (1:1). Jeremiah recounts more of his own life than any other prophet, telling of his ministry, the reactions of his audiences, testings, and his personal feelings. His name means &ldquo;Jehovah throws,&rdquo; in the sense of laying down a foundation, or &ldquo;Jehovah establishes, appoints, or sends.&rdquo;</p><p>Seven other Jeremiahs appear in Scripture (2 Kin. 23:31; 1 Chr. 5:24; 1 Chr. 12:4; 1 Chr. 12:10; 1 Chr. 12:13; Neh. 10:2; Neh. 12:1), and Jeremiah the prophet is named at least 9 times outside of his book (cf. 2 Chr. 35:25; 36:12; 36:21,22; Dan. 9:2; Ezra 1:1; Matt. 2:17; 16:14; 27:9). The Old and New Testaments quote Jeremiah at least 7 times: 1) Dan. 9:2 (25:11,12; 29:10); 2) Matt. 2:18 (31:15); 3) Matt. 27:9 (18:2; 19:2,11; 32:6&ndash;9); 4) 1 Cor. 1:31 (9:24); 5) 2 Cor. 10:17 (9:24); 6) Heb. 8:8&ndash;12 (31:31&ndash;34); and 7) Heb. 10:16,17 (31:33,34).</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>Jeremiah, who served as both a priest and a prophet, was the son of a priest named Hilkiah (not the High-Priest of 2 Kin. 22:8 who discovered the book of the law). He was from the small village of Anathoth (1:1), today called Anata, about 3 mi. NE of Jerusalem in Benjamin&rsquo;s tribal inheritance. As an object lesson to Judah, Jeremiah remained unmarried (16:1&ndash;4). He was assisted in ministry by a scribe, named Baruch, to whom Jeremiah dictated and who copied and had custody over the writings compiled from the prophet&rsquo;s messages (36:4,32; 45:1). Jeremiah has been known as &ldquo;the weeping prophet&rdquo; (cf. 9:1; 13:17; 14:17), living a life of conflict because of his predictions of judgment by the invading Babylonians. He was threatened, tried for his life, put in stocks, forced to flee from Jehoiakim, publicly humiliated by a false prophet, and thrown into a pit.</p><p>Jeremiah carried out a ministry directed mostly to his own people in Judah, but which expanded to other nations at times. He appealed to his countrymen to repent and avoid God&rsquo;s judgment via an invader (chaps. 7,26). Once invasion was certain after Judah refused to repent, he pled with them not to resist the Babylonian conqueror in order to prevent total destruction (chap. 27). He also called on delegates of other nations to heed his counsel and submit to Babylon (chap. 27), and he predicted judgments from God on various nations (25:12&ndash;38; chaps. 46&ndash;51).</p><p>The dates of his ministry, which spanned 5 decades, are from the Judean king Josiah&rsquo;s 13th year, noted in 1:2 (627 B.C.), to beyond the fall of Jerusalem to Babylon in 586 B.C. (Jer. 39,40,52). After 586 B.C., Jeremiah was forced to go with a fleeing remnant of Judah to Egypt (Jer. 43,44). He was possibly still ministering in 570 B.C. (see note on 44:30). A rabbinic note claims that when Babylon invaded Egypt in 568/67 B.C. Jeremiah was taken captive to Babylon. He could have lived even to pen the book&rsquo;s closing scene ca. 561 B.C. in Babylon, when Judah&rsquo;s king Jehoiachin, captive in Babylon since 597 B.C., was allowed liberties in his last days (52:31&ndash;34). Jeremiah, if still alive at that time, was between 85 and 90 years old.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>Background details of Jeremiah&rsquo;s times are portrayed in 2 Kin. 22&ndash;25 and 2 Chr. 34&ndash;36. Jeremiah&rsquo;s messages paint pictures of: 1) his people&rsquo;s sin; 2) the invader God would send; 3) the rigors of siege; and 4) calamities of destruction. Jeremiah&rsquo;s message of impending judgment for idolatry and other sins was preached over a period of 40 years (ca. 627&ndash;586 B.C. and beyond). His prophecy took place during the reigns of Judah&rsquo;s final 5 kings (Josiah 640&ndash;609 B.C., Jehoahaz 609 B.C., Jehoiakim 609&ndash;598 B.C., Jehoiachin 598&ndash;597 B.C., and Zedekiah 597&ndash;586 B.C.).</p><p>The spiritual condition of Judah was one of flagrant idol worship (cf. chap. 2). King Ahaz, preceding his son Hezekiah long before Jeremiah in Isaiah&rsquo;s day, had set up a system of sacrificing children to the god Molech in the Valley of Hinnom just outside Jerusalem (735&ndash;715 B.C.). Hezekiah led in reforms and clean-up (Is. 36:7), but his son Manasseh continued to foster child sacrifice along with gross idolatry, which continued into Jeremiah&rsquo;s time (7:31; 19:5; 32:35). Many also worshiped the &ldquo;queen of heaven&rdquo; (7:18; 44:19). Josiah&rsquo;s reforms, reaching their apex in 622 B.C., forced a repressing of the worst practices outwardly, but the deadly cancer of sin was deep and flourished quickly again after a shallow revival. Religious insincerity, dishonesty, adultery, injustice, tyranny against the helpless, and slander prevailed as the norm not the exception.</p><p>Politically momentous events occurred in Jeremiah&rsquo;s day. Assyria saw its power wane gradually; then Ashurbanipal died in 626 B.C. Assyria grew so feeble that in 612 B.C. her seemingly invincible capital, Nineveh, was destroyed (cf. the book of Nahum). The Neo-Babylonian empire under Nabopolassar (625&ndash;605 B.C.) became dominant militarily with victories against Assyria (612 B.C.), Egypt (609&ndash;605 B.C.), and Israel in 3 phases (605 B.C., as in Dan. 1; 597 B.C., as in 2 Kin. 24:10&ndash;16; and 586 B.C., as in Jer. 39,40,52).</p><p>While Joel and Micah had earlier prophesied of Judah&rsquo;s judgment, during Josiah&rsquo;s reign, God&rsquo;s leading prophets were Jeremiah, Habakkuk, and Zephaniah. Later, Jeremiah&rsquo;s contemporaries, Ezekiel and Daniel, played prominent prophetic roles.</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>The main theme of Jeremiah is judgment upon Judah (chaps. 1&ndash;29) with restoration in the future messianic kingdom (23:3&ndash;8; 30&ndash;33). Whereas Isaiah devoted many chapters to a future glory for Israel (Is. 40&ndash;66), Jeremiah gave far less space to this subject. Since God&rsquo;s judgment was imminent he concentrated on current problems as he sought to turn the nation back from the point of no return.</p><p>A secondary theme is God&rsquo;s willingness to spare and bless the nation only if the people repent. Though this is a frequent emphasis, it is most graphically portrayed at the potter&rsquo;s shop (18:1&ndash;11). A further focus is God&rsquo;s plan for Jeremiah&rsquo;s life, both in his proclamation of God&rsquo;s message and in his commitment to fulfill all of His will (1:5&ndash;19; 15:19&ndash;21). Other themes include: 1) God&rsquo;s longing for Israel to be tender toward Him, as in the days of first love (2:1&ndash;3); 2) Jeremiah&rsquo;s servant tears, as &ldquo;the weeping prophet&rdquo; (9:1; 14:17); 3) the close, intimate relationship God had with Israel and that He yearned to keep (13:11); 4) suffering, as in Jeremiah&rsquo;s trials (11:18&ndash;23; 20:1&ndash;18) and God&rsquo;s sufficiency in all trouble (20:11&ndash;13); 5) the vital role that God&rsquo;s Word can play in life (15:16); 6) the place of faith in expecting restoration from the God for whom nothing is too difficult (chap. 32, especially vv. 17,27); and 7) prayer for the coordination of God&rsquo;s will with God&rsquo;s action in restoring Israel to its land (33:3,6&ndash;18).</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>A number of questions arise, such as: 1) How can one explain God&rsquo;s forbidding prayer for the Jews (7:16) and saying that even Moses&rsquo; and Samuel&rsquo;s advocacy could not avert judgment (15:1)? 2) Did Jeremiah make an actual trek of several hundred miles to the Euphrates River, or<br />did he bury his loin cloth nearby (13:4&ndash;7)? 3) How could he utter such severe things about the man who announced his birth (20:14&ndash;18)? 4) Does the curse on Jeconiah&rsquo;s kingly line relate to Christ (22:30)? 5) How is one to interpret the promises of Israel&rsquo;s return to its ancient land<br />(chaps. 30&ndash;33)? and 6) How will God fulfill the New Covenant in relation to Israel and the church (31:31&ndash;34)? The answers to these will be included in the study notes at the appropriate passages.</p><p>A frequent challenge is to understand the prophet&rsquo;s messages in their right time setting, since the book of Jeremiah is not always chronological, but loosely arranged, moving back and forth in time for thematic effect. Ezekiel, by contrast, usually places his material in chronological order.</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I. Preparation of Jeremiah (1:1&ndash;19)</strong></p><blockquote><p>A.

"25","25","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Lamentations&rdquo; was derived from a translation of the title as found in the Latin Vulgate (Vg.) translation of the Greek OT, the Septuagint (LXX), and conveys the idea of &ldquo;loud cries.&rdquo; The Hebrew exclamation ekah (&ldquo;How,&rdquo;which expresses &ldquo;dismay&rdquo;), used in 1:1; 2:1, and 4:1, gives the book its Hebrew title. However, the rabbis began early to call the book &ldquo;loud cries&rdquo; or &ldquo;lamentations&rdquo; (cf. Jer. 7:29). No other entire OT book contains only laments, as does this distressful dirge, marking the funeral of the once beautiful city of Jerusalem (cf. 2:15). This book keeps alive the memory of that fall and teaches all believers how to deal with suffering.</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>The author of Lamentations is not named within the book, but there are internal and historical indications that it was Jeremiah. The LXX introduces Lam. 1:1, &ldquo;And it came to pass, after Israel had been carried away captive &hellip; Jeremiah sat weeping [cf. 3:48,49, etc.] &hellip; lamented &hellip; and said &hellip;.&rdquo; God had told Jeremiah to have Judah lament (Jer. 7:29), and Jeremiah also wrote laments for Josiah (2 Chr. 35:25).</p><p>Jeremiah wrote Lamentations as an eyewitness (cf. 1:13&ndash;15; 2:6,9; 4:1&ndash;12), possibly with Baruch&rsquo;s secretarial help (cf. Jer. 36:4; 45:1), during or soon after Jerusalem&rsquo;s fall in 586 B.C. It was mid-July when the city fell and mid-August when the temple was burned. Likely,<br />Jeremiah saw the destruction of walls, towers, homes, palace, and temple; he wrote while the event remained painfully fresh in his memory, but before his forced departure to Egypt ca. 583 B.C. (cf. Jer. 43:1&ndash;7). The language used in Lamentations closely parallels that used by<br />Jeremiah in his much larger prophetic book (cf. 1:2 with Jer. 30:14; 1:15 with Jer. 8:21; 1:6 and 2:11 with Jer. 9:1,18; 2:22 with Jer. 6:25; 4:21 with Jer. 49:12).</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>The prophetic seeds of Jerusalem&rsquo;s destruction were sown through Joshua 800 years in advance (Josh. 23:15,16). Now, for over 40 years, Jeremiah had prophesied of coming judgment and been scorned by the people for preaching doom (ca. 645&ndash;605 B.C.). When that judgment came on the disbelieving people from Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonian army, Jeremiah still responded with great sorrow and compassion toward his suffering and obstinate people. Lamentations relates closely to the book of Jeremiah, describing the anguish over Jerusalem&rsquo;s receiving God&rsquo;s judgment for unrepentant sins. In the book that bears his name, Jeremiah had predicted the calamity in chaps. 1&ndash;29. In Lamentations, he concentrates in more detail on the bitter suffering and heartbreak that was felt over Jerusalem&rsquo;s devastation (cf. Ps. 46:4,5). So critical was Jerusalem&rsquo;s destruction, that the facts are recorded in 4 separate OT chapters: 2 Kin. 25; Jer. 39:1&ndash;11; 52; and 2 Chr. 36:11&ndash;21.</p><p>All 154 verses have been recognized by the Jews as a part of their sacred canon. Along with Ruth, Esther, Song of Solomon, and Ecclesiastes, Lamentations is included among the OT books of the Megilloth, or &ldquo;five scrolls,&rdquo; which were read in the synagogue on special occasions. Lamentations is read on the 9th of Ab (July/Aug.) to remember the date of Jerusalem&rsquo;s destruction by Nebuchadnezzar. Interestingly, this same date later marked the destruction of Herod&rsquo;s temple by the Romans in A.D. 70.</p><br /><table style=""width: 730px; height: 897px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0""><tbody><tr><td colspan=""5"" width=""576"" align=""center"" valign=""top""><p><strong>Second Kings, Jeremiah, and Lamentations Compared</strong></p><br /></td></tr><tr><td width=""20"" valign=""top""><br /><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><br /><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p><strong>2 Kings 25</strong></p><p>(See also 2Ch 36:11&ndash;21)</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p><strong>Jeremiah</strong></p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p><strong>Lamentations</strong></p><br /></td></tr><tr><td width=""20"" valign=""top""><p>1.</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>The siege of Jerusalem</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>1, 2</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>39:1&ndash;3; 52:4, 5</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>2:20&ndash;22; 3:5, 7</p><br /></td></tr><tr><td width=""20"" valign=""top""><p>2.</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>The famine in the city</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>3</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>37:21; 52:6</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>1:11, 19; 2:11, 12; 2:19, 20; 4:4, 5, 9, 10; 5:9, 10</p><br /></td></tr><tr><td width=""20"" valign=""top""><p>3.</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>The flight of the army and the king</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>4&ndash;7</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>39:4&ndash;7; 52:8&ndash;11</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>1:3, 6; 2:2; 4:19, 20</p><br /></td></tr><tr><td width=""20"" valign=""top""><p>4.</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>The burning of the palace, temple, and city</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>8, 9</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>39:8; 52:13</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>2:3&ndash;5; 4:11; 5:18</p><br /></td></tr><tr><td width=""20"" valign=""top""><p>5.</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>The breaching of the city walls</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>10</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>33:4, 5; 52:7</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>2:7&ndash;9</p><br /></td></tr><tr><td width=""20"" valign=""top""><p>6.</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>The exile of the populace</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>11, 12</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>28:3, 4, 14; 39:9, 10</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>1:1, 4, 5, 18; 2:9, 14; 3:2, 19; 4:22; 5:2</p><br /></td></tr><tr><td width=""20"" valign=""top""><p>7.</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>The looting of the temple</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>13&ndash;15</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>51:51</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>1:10; 2:6, 7</p><br /></td></tr><tr><td width=""20"" valign=""top""><p>8.</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>The execution of the leaders</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>18&ndash;21</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>39:6</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>1:15; 2:2, 20</p><br /></td></tr><tr><td width=""20"" valign=""top""><p>9.</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>The vassal status of Judah</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>22&ndash;25</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>40:9</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>1:1; 5:8, 9</p><br /></td></tr><tr><td width=""20"" valign=""top""><p>10.</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>The collapse of the expected foreign help</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>24:7</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>27:1&ndash;11; 37:5&ndash;10</p><br /></td><td width=""115"" valign=""top""><p>4:17; 5:6</p><br /></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>The chief focus of Lamentations is on God&rsquo;s judgment in response to Judah&rsquo;s sin. This theme can be traced throughout the book (1:5,8,18,20; 3:42; 4:6,13,22; 5:16). A second theme which surfaces is the hope found in God&rsquo;s compassion (as in 3:22&ndash;24,31&ndash;33; cf. Ps. 30:3&ndash;5). Though the book deals with disgrace, it turns to God&rsquo;s great faithfulness (3:22&ndash;25) and closes with grace as Jeremiah moves from lamentation to consolation (5:19&ndash;22).</p><p>God&rsquo;s sovereign judgment represents a third current in the book. His holiness was so offended by Judah&rsquo;s sin that He ultimately brought the destructive calamity. Babylon was chosen to be His human instrument of wrath (1:5,12,15; 2:1,17; 3:37,38; cf. Jer. 50:23). Jeremiah mentions Babylon more than 150 times from Jer. 20:4 to 52:34, but in Lamentations he never once explicitly names Babylon or its king, Nebuchadnezzar. Only the Lord is identified as the One who dealt with Judah&rsquo;s sin.</p><p>Fourth, because the sweeping judgment seemed to be the end of every hope of Israel&rsquo;s salvation and the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s promises (cf. 3:18), much of the book appears in the mode of prayer: 1) 1:11, which represents a wailing confession of sin (cf. v. 18); 2) 3:8, with its<br />anguish when God &ldquo;shuts out my prayer&rdquo; (cf. Jer. 7:16; Lam. 3:43&ndash;54); 3) 3:55&ndash;59, where Jeremiah cries to God for relief, or 3:60&ndash;66, where he seeks for recompense to the enemies (which Jer. 50,51 guarantees); and 4) 5:1&ndash;22, with its appeal to heaven for restored mercy (which Jer. 30&ndash;33 assures), based on the confidence that God is faithful (3:23).</p><p>A fifth feature relates to Christ. Jeremiah&rsquo;s tears (3:48,49) compare with Jesus&rsquo; weeping over the same city of Jerusalem (Matt. 23:37&ndash;39; Luke 19:41&ndash;44). Though God was the judge and executioner, it was a grief to Him to bring this destruction. The statement &ldquo;In all their<br />affliction, He [God] was afflicted&rdquo; (Is. 63:9) was true in principle. God will one day wipe away all tears (Is. 25:8; Rev. 7:17; 21:4) when sin shall be no more.</p><p>A sixth theme is an implied warning to all who read this book. If God did not hesitate to judge His beloved people (Deut. 32:10), what will He do to the nations of the world who reject His Word?</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>Certain details pose initial difficulties. Among them are: 1) imprecatory prayers for judgment on other sinners (1:21&ndash;22; 3:64&ndash;66); 2) the reason for God shutting out prayer (3:8); and 3) the necessity of judgment that is so severe (cf. 1:1,14; 3:8).</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p>In the first 4 chapters, each verse begins in an acrostic pattern, i.e., using the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet in sequence. Chapters 1, 2, and 4 have 22 verses corresponding to 22 letters, while chap. 3 employs each letter for 3 consecutive verses until there are 22 trios, or 66 verses. Chapter 5 is not written alphabetically, although it simulates the pattern in that it has 22 verses. An acrostic order, such as in Ps. 119 (where all 22 Hebrew letters are used in series of 8 verses each), was used to aid memorization. The structure of the book ascends and descends from the great confession in 3:22&ndash;24, &ldquo;Great is His faithfulness,&rdquo; which is the literal center of the book.</p><p><strong>I.

"26","26","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>The book has always been named for its author, Ezekiel (1:3; 24:24), who is nowhere else mentioned in Scripture. His name means &ldquo;strengthened by God,&rdquo; which, indeed, he was for the prophetic ministry to which God called him (3:8,9). Ezekiel uses visions, prophecies, parables, signs, and symbols to proclaim and dramatize the message of God to His exiled people.</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>If the &ldquo;thirtieth year&rdquo; of 1:1 refers to Ezekiel&rsquo;s age, he was 25 when taken captive and 30 when called into ministry. Thirty was the age when priests commenced their office, so it was a notable year for Ezekiel. His ministry began in 593/92 B.C. and extended at least 22 years until 571/70 B.C. (cf. 25:17). He was a contemporary of both Jeremiah (who was about 20 years older) and Daniel (who was the same age), whom he names in 14:14,20; 28:3 as an already well known prophet. Like Jeremiah (Jer. 1:1) and Zechariah (cf. Zech. 1:1 with Neh. 12:16), Ezekiel was both a prophet and a priest (1:3). Because of his priestly background, he was particularly interested in and familiar with the temple details; so God used him to write much about them (8:1&ndash;11:25; 40:1&ndash;47:12).</p><p>Ezekiel and his wife (who is mentioned in 24:15&ndash;27) were among 10,000 Jews taken captive to Babylon in 597 B.C. (2 Kin. 24:11&ndash;18). They lived in Tel-Abib (3:15) on the bank of the Chebar River, probably SE of Babylon. Ezekiel writes of his wife&rsquo;s death in exile (Ezek. 24:18), but the book does not mention Ezekiel&rsquo;s death, which rabbinical tradition suggests occurred at the hands of an Israelite prince whose idolatry he rebuked around 560 B.C.</p><p>The author received his call to prophesy in 593 B.C. (1:2), in Babylon (&ldquo;the land of the Chaldeans&rdquo;), during the fifth year of King Jehoiachin&rsquo;s captivity, which began in 597 B.C. Frequently, Ezekiel dates his prophecies from 597 B.C. (8:1; 20:1; 24:1; 26:1; 29:1; 30:20; 31:1; 32:1,17; 33:21; 40:1). He also dates the message in 40:1 as 573/72, the 14th year after 586 B.C., i.e., Jerusalem&rsquo;s final fall. The last dated utterance of Ezekiel was in 571/70 B.C. (29:17).</p><p>Prophecies in chaps. 1&ndash;28 are in chronological order. In 29:1, the prophet regresses to a year earlier than in 26:1. But from 30:1 on (cf. 31:1; 32:1,17), he is close to being strictly chronological.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>From the historical perspective, Israel&rsquo;s united kingdom lasted more than 110 years (ca. 1043&ndash;931 B.C.), through the reigns of Saul, David, and Solomon. Then the divided kingdom, Israel (north) and Judah (south), extended from 931 B.C. to 722/21 B.C. Israel fell to Assyria in<br />722/21 B.C. leaving Judah, the surviving kingdom for 135 years, which fell to Babylon in 605&ndash;586 B.C.</p><p>In the more immediate setting, several features were strategic. Politically, Assyria&rsquo;s vaunted military might crumbled after 626 B.C., and the capital, Nineveh, was destroyed in 612 B.C. by the Babylonians and Medes (cf. Nahum). The neo-Babylonian empire had flexed its muscles since Nabopolassar took the throne in 625 B.C., and Egypt, under Pharaoh Necho II, was determined to conquer what she could. Babylon smashed Assyria in 612&ndash;605 B.C., and registered a decisive victory against Egypt in 605 B.C. at Carchemish, leaving, according to the Babylonian Chronicle, no survivors. Also in 605 B.C., Babylon, led by Nebuchadnezzar, began the conquest of Jerusalem and the deportation of captives, among them Daniel (Dan. 1:2). In Dec., 598 B.C., he again besieged Jerusalem, and on Mar. 16, 597 B.C. took possession. This time, he took captive Jehoiachin and a group of 10,000, including Ezekiel (2 Kin. 24:11&ndash;18). The final destruction of Jerusalem and the conquest of Judah, including the third deportation, came in 586 B.C.</p><p>Religiously, King Josiah (ca. 640&ndash;609 B.C.) had instituted reforms in Judah (cf. 2 Chr. 34). Tragically, despite his effort, idolatry had so dulled the Judeans that their awakening was only &ldquo;skin deep&rdquo; overall. The Egyptian army killed Josiah as it crossed Palestine in 609 B.C., and the Jews plunged on in sin toward judgment under Jehoahaz (609 B.C.), Jehoiakim [Eliakim] (609&ndash;598 B.C.), Jehoiachin (598&ndash;597 B.C.), and Zedekiah (597&ndash;586 B.C.).</p><p>Domestically, Ezekiel and the 10,000 lived in exile in Babylonia (2 Kin. 24:14), more as colonists than captives, being permitted to farm tracts of land under somewhat favorable conditions (Jer. 29). Ezekiel even had his own house (3:24; 20:1).</p><p>Prophetically, false prophets deceived the exiles with assurances of a speedy return to Judah (13:3,16; Jer. 29:1). From 593&ndash;585 B.C., Ezekiel warned that their beloved Jerusalem would be destroyed and their exile prolonged, so there was no hope of immediate return. In 585 B.C., an escapee from Jerusalem, who had evaded the Babylonians, reached Ezekiel with the first news that the city had fallen in 586 B.C., about 6 months earlier (33:21). That dashed the false hopes of any immediate deliverance for the exiles, so the remainder of Ezekiel&rsquo;s prophecies related to Israel&rsquo;s future restoration to its homeland and the final blessings of the messianic kingdom.</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>The &ldquo;glory of the Lord&rdquo; is central to Ezekiel, appearing in 1:28; 3:12,23; 10:4,18; 11:23; 43:4,5; 44:4. The book includes graphic descriptions of the disobedience of Israel and Judah, despite God&rsquo;s kindness (chap. 23; cf. chap. 16). It shows God&rsquo;s desire for Israel to bear fruit which He can bless; however, selfish indulgence had left Judah ready for judgment, like a torched vine (chap. 15). References are plentiful to Israel&rsquo;s idolatry and its consequences, such as Pelatiah dropping dead (11:13), a symbolic illustration of overall disaster for the people.</p><p>Many picturesque scenes illustrate spiritual principles. Among these are Ezekiel eating a scroll (chap. 2); the faces on 4 angels representing aspects of creation over which God rules (1:10); a &ldquo;barbershop&rdquo; scene (5:1&ndash;4); graffiti on temple walls reminding readers of what God<br />really wants in His dwelling place, namely holiness and not ugliness (8:10); and sprinkled hot coals depicting judgment (10:2,7).</p><p>Chief among the theological themes are God&rsquo;s holiness and sovereignty. These are conveyed by frequent contrast of His bright glory against the despicable backdrop of Judah&rsquo;s sins (1:26&ndash;28; often in chaps. 8&ndash;11; and 43:1&ndash;7). Closely related is God&rsquo;s purpose of glorious triumph so that all may &ldquo;know that I am the LORD.&rdquo; This divine monogram, God&rsquo;s signature authenticating His acts, is mentioned more than 60 times, usually with a judgment (6:7; 7:4), but occasionally after the promised restoration (34:27; 36:11,38; 39:28).</p><p>Another feature involves God&rsquo;s angels carrying out His program behind the scenes (1:5&ndash;25; 10:1&ndash;22). A further important theme is God&rsquo;s holding each individual accountable for pursuing righteousness (18:3&ndash;32).</p><p>Ezekiel also stresses sinfulness in Israel (2:3&ndash;7; 8:9,10) and other nations (throughout chaps. 25&ndash;32). He deals with the necessity of God&rsquo;s wrath to deal with sin (7:1&ndash;8; 15:8); God&rsquo;s frustration of man&rsquo;s devices to escape from besieged Jerusalem (12:1&ndash;13; cf. Jer. 39:4&ndash;7); and<br />God&rsquo;s grace pledged in the Abrahamic Covenant (Gen. 12:1&ndash;3) being fulfilled by restoring Abraham&rsquo;s people to the land of the covenant (chaps. 34,36&ndash;48; cf. Gen. 12:7). God promises to preserve a remnant of Israelites through whom He will fulfill His restoration promises and<br />keep His inviolate Word.</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>Ezekiel uses extensive symbolic language, as did Isaiah and Jeremiah. This raises the question as to whether certain portions of Ezekiel&rsquo;s writings are to be taken literally or figuratively, e.g., being bound with ropes, 3:25; whether the prophet was taken bodily to Jerusalem, 8:1&ndash;3; how individual judgment can be worked out in chap. 18 when the wicked elude death in 14:22,23 and some of the godly die in an invasion, 21:3,4; how God would permit a faithful prophet&rsquo;s wife to die (24:15&ndash;27); when some of the judgments on other nations will occur (chaps. 25&ndash;32); whether the temple in chaps. 40&ndash;46 will be a literal one and in what form; and how promises of Israel&rsquo;s future relate to God&rsquo;s program with the church.</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p>The book can be largely divided into sections about condemnation/retribution and then consolation/restoration. A more detailed look divides the book into 4 sections. First, are prophecies on the ruin of Jerusalem (chaps. 1&ndash;24). Second, are prophecies of retribution on nearby nations (chaps. 25&ndash;32), with a glimpse at God&rsquo;s future restoration of Israel (28:25,26). Thirdly, there is a transition chapter (33) which gives instruction concerning a last call for Israel to repent. Finally, the fourth division includes rich expectations involving God&rsquo;s future restoration of Israel (chaps. 34&ndash;48).</p><p><strong>I.

"27","27","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>According to Hebrew custom, the title is drawn from the prophet who throughout the book received revelations from God. Daniel bridges the entire 70 years of the Babylonian captivity (ca. 605&ndash;536 B.C.; cf. 1:1 and 9:1&ndash;3). Nine of the 12 chapters relate revelation through dreams/visions. Daniel was God&rsquo;s mouthpiece to the Gentile and Jewish world, declaring God&rsquo;s current and future plans. What Revelation is to the NT prophetically and apocalyptically, Daniel is to the OT.</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>Several verses indicate that the writer is Daniel (8:15,27; 9:2; 10:2,7; 12:4,5), whose name means &ldquo;God is my Judge.&rdquo; He wrote in the autobiographical first person from 7:2 on, and is to be distinguished from the other 3 Daniel&rsquo;s of the OT (cf. 1 Chr. 3:1; Ezra 8:2; Neh. 10:6). As a teenager, possibly about 15 years old, Daniel was kidnaped from his noble family in Judah and deported to Babylon to be brainwashed into Babylonian culture for the task of assisting in dealing with the imported Jews. There he spent the remainder of a long life (85 years or more). He made the most of the exile, successfully exalting God by his character and service. He quickly rose to the role of statesman by official royal appointment and served as a confidante of kings as well as a prophet in two world empires, i.e., the Babylonian (2:48) and<br />the Medo-Persian (6:1,2). Christ confirmed Daniel as the author of this book (cf. Matt. 24:15).</p><p>Daniel lived beyond the time described in Dan. 10:1 (ca. 536 B.C.). It seems most probable that he wrote the book shortly after this date but before ca. 530 B.C. Daniel 2:4b&ndash;7:28, which prophetically describes the course of Gentile world history, was originally and appropriately written in Aramaic, the contemporary language of international business. Ezekiel, Habakkuk, Jeremiah, and Zephaniah were Daniel&rsquo;s prophetic contemporaries.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>The book begins in 605 B.C. when Babylon conquered Jerusalem and exiled Daniel, his 3 friends, and others. It continues to the eventual demise of Babylonian supremacy in 539 B.C., when Medo-Persian besiegers conquered Babylon (5:30,31), and goes even beyond that to<br />536 B.C. (10:1). After Daniel was transported to Babylon, the Babylonian victors conquered Jerusalem in two further stages (597 B.C. and 586 B.C.). In both takeovers, they deported more Jewish captives. Daniel passionately remembered his home, particularly the temple at Jerusalem, almost 70 years after having been taken away from it (6:10).</p><p>Daniel&rsquo;s background is alluded to in part by Jeremiah, who names 3 of the last 5 kings in Judah before captivity (cf. Jer. 1:1&ndash;3): Josiah (ca. 641&ndash;609 B.C.), Jehoiakim (ca. 609&ndash;597 B.C.) and Zedekiah (597&ndash;586 B.C.). Jehoahaz (ca. 609 B.C.) and Jehoiachin (ca. 598&ndash;597 B.C.) are not mentioned (cf. Jeremiah Introduction: Background and Setting). Daniel is also mentioned by Ezekiel (cf. 14:14,20; 28:3) as being righteous and wise. He is alluded to by the writer of Hebrews as one of &ldquo; &hellip; the prophets: who through faith &hellip; stopped the mouths of lions&rdquo; (Heb. 11:32,33).</p><p>The long-continued sin of the Judeans without national repentance eventually led to God&rsquo;s judgment for which Jeremiah, Habakkuk, and Zephaniah had given fair warning. Earlier, Isaiah and other faithful prophets of God had also trumpeted the danger. When Assyrian power had ebbed by 625 B.C., the Neo-Babylonians conquered: 1) Assyria with its capital Nineveh in 612 B.C.; 2) Egypt in the following years; and 3) Judah in 605 B.C. when they overthrew Jerusalem in the first of 3 steps (also 597 B.C., 586 B.C.). Daniel was one of the first groups of deportees, and Ezekiel followed in 597 B.C.</p><p>Israel of the northern kingdom had earlier fallen to Assyria in 722 B.C. With Judah&rsquo;s captivity, the judgment was complete. In Babylon, Daniel received God&rsquo;s word concerning successive stages of Gentile world domination through the centuries until the greatest Conqueror, Messiah, would put down all Gentile lordship. He then will defeat all foes and raise His covenant people to blessing in His glorious millennial kingdom.</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>Daniel was written to encourage the exiled Jews by revealing God&rsquo;s program for them, both during and after the time of Gentile power in the world. Prominent above every other theme in the book is God&rsquo;s sovereign control over the affairs of all rulers and nations, and their final replacement with the True King. The key verses are 2:20&ndash;22,44 (cf. 2:28,37; 4:34&ndash;35; 6:25&ndash;27). God had not suffered defeat in allowing Israel&rsquo;s fall (Dan. 1), but was providentially working His sure purposes toward an eventual full display of His King, the exalted Christ. He<br />sovereignly allowed Gentiles to dominate Israel, i.e., Babylon (605&ndash;539 B.C.), Medo-Persia (539&ndash;331 B.C.), Greece (331&ndash;146 B.C.), Rome (146 B.C.&ndash;A.D. 476), and all the way to the Second Advent of Christ. These stages in Gentile power are set forth in chaps. 2 and 7. This same<br />theme also embraces Israel&rsquo;s experience both in defeat and finally in her kingdom blessing in chaps. 8&ndash;12 (cf. 2:35,45; 7:27). A key aspect within the over-arching theme of God&rsquo;s kingly control is Messiah&rsquo;s coming to rule the world in glory over all men (2:35,45; 7:13,14,27). He is<br />like a stone in chap. 2, and like a son of man in chap. 7. In addition, He is the Anointed One (Messiah) in chap. 9:26. Chapter 9 provides the chronological framework from Daniel&rsquo;s time to Christ&rsquo;s kingdom.</p><p>A second theme woven into the fabric of Daniel is the display of God&rsquo;s sovereign power through miracles. Daniel&rsquo;s era is one of 6 in the Bible with a major focus on miracles by which God accomplished His purposes. Other periods include: 1) the Creation and Flood (Gen. 1&ndash;11); 2) the patriarchs and Moses (Gen. 12&ndash;Deut.); 3) Elijah and Elisha (1 Kin. 19&ndash;2 Kin. 13); 4) Jesus and the apostles (Gospels, Acts); and 5) the time of the Second Advent (Revelation). God, who has everlasting dominion and ability to work according to His will (4:34,35), is capable of<br />miracles, all of which would be lesser displays of power than was exhibited when He acted as Creator in Gen. 1:1. Daniel chronicles the God-enabled recounting and interpreting of dreams which God used to reveal His will (chaps. 2,4,7). Other miracles included: 1) His writing on the wall and Daniel&rsquo;s interpreting it (chap. 5); 2) His protection of the 3 men in a blazing furnace (chap. 3); 3) His provision of safety for Daniel in a lions&rsquo; den (chap. 6); and 4) supernatural prophecies (chaps. 2; 7; 8; 9:24&ndash;12:13).</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>The main challenges center on interpreting passages about future tribulation and kingdom promises. Though the use of Imperial Aramaic and archeology have confirmed the early date of writing, some skeptical interpreters, unwilling to acknowledge supernatural prophecies that came to pass (there are over 100 in chap. 11 alone that were fulfilled), place these details in the intertestamental times. They see these prophecies, not as miraculously foretelling the future, but as simply the observations of a later writer, who is recording events of his own day. Thus, they date Daniel in the days of Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175&ndash;164 B.C., chap. 8; 11:21&ndash;45). According to this scheme, the expectation of the Stone and Son of Man (chaps. 2,7) turned out to be a mistaken notion that did not actually come to pass, or the writer was being intentionally deceptive. Actually, a future 7 year judgment period (cf. 7:21,22; 11:36&ndash;45; 12:1) and a literal 1,000 year kingdom (cf. Rev. 20) after Christ&rsquo;s second coming when He will reign over Israelites and Gentiles (7:27) is taught. This will be an era before and distinct from the final, absolutely perfect, ultimate state, i.e., the new heaven and the new earth with its capital, the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21,22). The literal interpretation ofprophecy, including Daniel, leads to the premillennial perspective.</p><p>Many other aspects of interpretation challenge readers: e.g., interpreting numbers (1:12,20; 3:19; 9:24&ndash;27); identifying the one like a Son of Man (7:13,14); determining whether to see Antiochus of the past or Antichrist of the far future in 8:19&ndash;23; explaining the &ldquo;seventy sevens&rdquo; in 9:24&ndash;27; and deciding whether Antiochus of 11:21&ndash;35 is still meant in 11:36&ndash;45, or whether it is the future Antichrist.</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I.

"28","28","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>The title is derived from the main character and author of the book. The meaning of his name, &ldquo;salvation,&rdquo; is the same as that of Joshua (cf. Num. 13:8,16) and Jesus (Matt. 1:21). Hosea is the first of the 12 Minor Prophets. &ldquo;Minor&rdquo; refers to the brevity of the prophecies, as compared to the length of the works of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel.</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>The book of Hosea is the sole source of information about the author. Little is known about him, and even less about his father, Beeri (1:1). Hosea was probably a native of the northern kingdom of Israel, since he shows familiarity with the history, circumstances, and topography of the north (cf. 4:15; 5:1,13; 6:8,9; 10:5; 12:11,12; 14:6). This would make him and Jonah the only writing prophets from the northern kingdom. Although he addressed both Israel (the northern kingdom) and Judah (the southern kingdom), he identified the king of Israel as &ldquo;our king&rdquo; (7:5).</p><p>Hosea had a lengthy period of ministry, prophesying ca. 755&ndash;710 B.C., during the reigns of Uzziah (790&ndash;739 B.C.), Jotham (750&ndash;731 B.C.), Ahaz (735&ndash;715 B.C.), and Hezekiah (715&ndash;686 B.C.) in Judah, and Jeroboam II (793&ndash;753 B.C.) in Israel (1:1). His long career spanned the last 6 kings of Israel from Zechariah (753&ndash;752 B.C.) to Hoshea (732&ndash;722 B.C.). The overthrow of Zechariah (the last of the dynasty of Jehu) in 752 B.C. is depicted as yet future (1:4). Thus he followed Amos&rsquo; preaching in the north, and was a contemporary of Isaiah and Micah as well, both of whom prophesied in Judah. Second Kings 14&ndash;20 and 2 Chronicles 26&ndash;32 record the historical period of Hosea&rsquo;s ministry.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>Hosea began his ministry to Israel (also called Ephraim, after its largest tribe) during the final days of Jeroboam II, under whose guidance Israel was enjoying both political peace and material prosperity as well as moral corruption and spiritual bankruptcy. Upon Jeroboam II&rsquo;s death (753 B.C.), however, anarchy prevailed and Israel declined rapidly. Until her overthrow by Assyria 20 years later, 4 of Israel&rsquo;s 6 kings were assassinated by their successors. Prophesying during the days surrounding the fall of Samaria, Hosea focuses on Israel&rsquo;s moral waywardness (cf. the book of Amos) and her breach of the convenantal relationship with the Lord, announcing that judgment was imminent.</p><p>Circumstances were not much better in the southern kingdom. Usurping the priestly function, Uzziah had been struck with leprosy (2 Chr. 26:16&ndash;21); Jotham condoned idolatrous practices, opening the way for Ahaz to encourage Baal worship (2 Chr. 27:1&ndash;28:4). Hezekiah&rsquo;s revival served only to slow Judah&rsquo;s acceleration toward a fate similar to that of her northern sister. Weak kings on both sides of the border repeatedly sought out alliances with their heathen neighbors (7:11; cf. 2 Kin. 15:19; 16:7) rather than seeking the Lord&rsquo;s help.</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>The theme of Hosea is God&rsquo;s loyal love for His covenant people, Israel, in spite of their idolatry. Thus Hosea has been called the St. John (the apostle of love) of the OT. The Lord&rsquo;s true love for His people is unending and will tolerate no rival. Hosea&rsquo;s message contains much condemnation, both national and individual, but at the same time, he poignantly portrays the love of God toward His people with passionate emotion. Hosea was instructed by God to marry a certain woman, and experience with her a domestic life which was a dramatization of the sin and unfaithfulness of Israel. The marital life of Hosea and his wife, Gomer, provide the rich metaphor which clarifies the themes of the book: sin, judgment, and forgiving love.</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>That the faithless wife, Gomer, is symbolic of faithless Israel is without doubt; but questions remain. First, some suggest that the marital scenes in chaps. 1&ndash;3 should be taken only as allegory. However, there is nothing in the narrative, presented in simple prose, which would even question its literal occurrence. Much of its impact would be lost if not literal. When non-literal elements within the book are introduced, they are prefaced with &ldquo;saw&rdquo; (5:13; 9:10,13), the normal Hebraic means of introducing non-literal scenes. Furthermore, there is no account of a prophet ever making himself the subject of an allegory or parable.</p><p>Second, what are the moral implications of God&rsquo;s command for Hosea to marry a prostitute? It appears best to see Gomer as chaste at the time of marriage to Hosea, only later having become an immoral woman. The words &ldquo;take yourself a wife of harlotry&rdquo; are to be understood proleptically, i.e., looking to the future. An immoral woman could not serve as a picture of Israel coming out of Egypt (2:15; 9:10), who then later wandered away from God (11:1). Chapter 3 describes Hosea taking back his wife, who had been rejected because of adultery, a rejection that was unjustifiable if Hosea had married a prostitute with full knowledge of her character.</p><p>A third question arises concerning the relationship between chap. 1 and chap. 3 and whether the woman of chap. 3 is Gomer or another woman. There are a number of factors which suggest that the woman of chap. 3 is Gomer. In 1:2, God&rsquo;s command is to &ldquo;Go, take;&rdquo; in 3:1, however, His command is to &ldquo;Go again, love,&rdquo; suggesting that Hosea&rsquo;s love was to be renewed to the same woman. Furthermore, within the analogy of chap. 1, Gomer represents Israel. As God renews His love toward faithless Israel, so Hosea is to renew his love toward faithless Gomer. For Hos. 3 to denote a different woman would confuse the analogy.</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I. Adulterous Wife and Faithful Husband (1:1&ndash;3:5)</strong></p><blockquote><p>A.

"29","29","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>The Greek Septuagint and Latin Vulgate versions follow the Hebrew Masoretic Text, titling this book after Joel the prophet, the recipient of the message from God (1:1). The name means &ldquo;the LORD is God&rdquo; and refers to at least a dozen men in the OT. Joel is referred to only once in the NT (Acts 2:16&ndash;21).</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>The author identified himself only as &ldquo;Joel the son of Pethuel&rdquo; (1:1). The prophecy provides little else about the man. Even the name of his father is not mentioned elsewhere in the OT. Although he displayed a profound zeal for the temple sacrifices (1:9; 2:13&ndash;16), his familiarity with pastoral and agricultural life and his separation from the priests (1:13,14; 2:17) suggest he was not a Levite. Extrabiblical tradition records that he was from the tribe of Reuben, from the town of Bethom or Bethharam, located NE of the Dead Sea on the border of Reuben and Gad. The context of the prophecy, however, hints that he was a Judean from the Jerusalem vicinity, since the tone of a stranger is absent.</p><p>Dating the book relies solely on canonical position, historical allusions, and linguistic elements. Because of: 1) the lack of any mention of later world powers (Assyria, Babylon, or Persia); 2) the fact that Joel&rsquo;s style is like that of Hosea and Amos rather than of the post-Exilic prophets; and 3) the verbal parallels with other early prophets (Joel 3:16/Amos 1:2; Joel 3:18/Amos 9:13), a late ninth century B.C. date, during the reign of Joash (ca. 835&ndash;796 B.C.), seems most convincing. Nevertheless, while the date of the book cannot be known with certainty, the impact on its interpretation is minimal. The message of Joel is timeless, forming doctrine which could be repeated and applied in any age.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>Tyre, Sidon, and Philistia had made frequent military incursions into Israel (3:2ff.). An extended drought and massive invasion of locusts had stripped every green thing from the Land and brought severe economic devastation (1:7&ndash;20), leaving the southern kingdom weak. This physical disaster gives Joel the illustration for God&rsquo;s judgment. As the locusts were a judgment on sin, God&rsquo;s future judgments during the Day of the Lord will far exceed them. In that day, God will judge His enemies and bless the faithful. No mention is made of specific sins, nor is Judah rebuked for idolatry. Yet, possibly due to a calloused indifference, the prophet calls them to a bona fide repentance, admonishing them to &ldquo;rend your heart, and not your garments&rdquo; (2:13).</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>The theme of Joel is the Day of the Lord. It permeates all parts of Joel&rsquo;s message, making it the most sustained treatment in the entire OT (1:15; 2:1; 2:11; 2:31; 3:14). The phrase is employed 19 times by 8 different OT authors (Is. 2:12; 13:6,9; Ezek. 13:5; 30:3; Joel 1:15; 2:1,11,31; 3:14; Amos 5:18 [2x],20; Obad. 15; Zeph. 1:7,14 [2x]; Zech. 14:1; Mal. 4:5). The phrase does not have reference to a chronological time period, but to a general period of wrath and judgment uniquely belonging to the Lord. It is exclusively the day which unveils His character&mdash;mighty, powerful, and holy, thus terrifying His enemies. The Day of the Lord does not always refer to an eschatological event; on occasion it has a near historical fulfillment, as seen in Ezek. 13:5, where it speaks of the Babylonian conquest and destruction of Jerusalem. As is common in prophecy, the near fulfillment is an historic event upon which to comprehend the more distant, eschatological fulfillment.</p><p>The Day of the Lord is frequently associated with seismic disturbances (e.g., 2:1&ndash;11; 2:31; 3:16), violent weather (Ezek. 13:5ff.), clouds and thick darkness (e.g., 2:2; Zeph. 1:7ff.), cosmic upheaval (2:3,30), and as a &ldquo;great and very terrible&rdquo; (2:11) day that would &ldquo;come as destruction from the Almighty&rdquo; (1:15). The latter half of Joel depicts time subsequent to the Day of the Lord in terms of promise and hope. There will be a pouring out of the Spirit on all flesh, accompanied by prophetic utterances, dreams, visions (2:28,29), as well as the coming of Elijah, an epiphany bringing restoration and hope (Mal. 4:5,6). As a result of the Day of the Lord there will be physical blessings, fruitfulness, and prosperity (2:21ff.; 3:16&ndash;21). It is a day when judgment is poured out on sinners that subsequently leads to blessings on the penitent, and reaffirmation of God&rsquo;s covenant with His people. See note on 1 Thess. 5:2.</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>It is preferable to view chap. 1 as describing an actual invasion of locusts that devastated the Land. In chap. 2, a new level of description meets the interpreter. Here the prophet is projecting something beyond the locust plague of chap. 1, elevating the level of description to new heights, with increased intensity that is focused on the plague and the immediate necessity for true repentance. The prophet&rsquo;s choice of similes, such as &ldquo;like the appearance of horses&rdquo; (2:4) and &ldquo;like mighty men&rdquo; (2:7), suggests that he is still using the actual locusts to illustrate an invasion which can only be the massive overtaking of the final Day of the Lord.</p><p>A second issue confronting the interpreter is Peter&rsquo;s quotation from Joel 2:28&ndash;32 in Acts 2:16&ndash;21. Some have viewed the phenomena of Acts 2 and the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70 as the fulfillment of the Joel passage, while others have reserved its fulfillment to the final Day of the Lord only&mdash;but clearly Joel is referring to the final terrible Day of the Lord. The pouring out of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost was not a fulfillment, but a preview and sample of the Spirit&rsquo;s power and work to be released fully and finally in the Messiah&rsquo;s kingdom after the Day of the Lord. See note on Acts 2:16&ndash;21.</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p>Following 1:1, the contents of the book are arranged under 3 basic categories. In the first section (1:2&ndash;20) the prophet describes the contemporary Day of the Lord. The land is suffering massive devastation caused by a locust plague and drought. The details of the calamity (1:2&ndash;12) are followed by a summons to communal penitence and reformation (1:13&ndash;20).</p><p>The second section (2:1&ndash;17) provides a transition from the historical plague of locusts described in chap. 1 to the eschatological Day of the Lord in 2:18&ndash;3:21. Employing the contemporary infestation of locusts as a backdrop, the prophet, with an increased level of intensity, paints a vivid and forceful picture of the impending visitation of the Lord (2:1&ndash;11) and, with powerful and explicit terminology, tenaciously renews the appeal for repentance (2:12&ndash;17).</p><p>In the third section (2:18&ndash;3:21), the Lord speaks directly, assuring His people of His presence among them (2:27; 3:17,21). This portion of the book assumes that the repentance solicited (2:12&ndash;17) had occurred and describes the Lord&rsquo;s zealous response (2:18,19a) to their prayer. Joel 2:18&ndash;21 forms the transition in the message from lamentation and woe to divine assurances of God&rsquo;s presence and the reversal of the calamities, with 2:19b,20 introducing the essence and nature of that reversal. The Lord then gives 3 promises to assure the penitents of<br />His presence: material restoration through the divine healing of their land (2:21&ndash;27), spiritual restoration through the divine outpouring of His Spirit (2:28&ndash;32), and national restoration through the divine judgment on the unrighteous (3:1&ndash;21).</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I.

"30","30","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>As with each of the Minor Prophets, the title comes from the name of the prophet to whom God gave His message (1:1). Amos&rsquo; name means &ldquo;burden&rdquo; or &ldquo;burden-bearer.&rdquo; He is not to be confused with Amoz (&ldquo;stout, strong&rdquo;), the father of Isaiah (Is. 1:1).</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>Amos was from Tekoa, a small village 10 mi. S of Jerusalem. He was the only prophet to give his occupation before declaring his divine commission. He was not of priestly or noble descent, but worked as a &ldquo;sheepbreeder&rdquo; (1:1; cf. 2 Kin. 3:4) and a &ldquo;tender of sycamore fruit&rdquo; (7:14) and was a contemporary of Jonah (2 Kin. 14:25), Hosea (Hos. 1:1), and Isaiah (Is. 1:1). The date of writing is mid-eighth century B.C., during the reigns of Uzziah, king of Judah (ca. 790&ndash;739 B.C.) and Jeroboam II, king of Israel (ca. 793&ndash;753 B.C.), two years before a memorable earthquake (1:1; cf. Zech. 14:5, ca. 760 B.C.).</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>Amos was a Judean prophet called to deliver a message primarily to the northern tribes of Israel (7:15). Politically, it was a time of prosperity under the long and secure reign of Jeroboam II who, following the example of his father Joash (2 Kin. 13:25), significantly &ldquo;restored the territory of Israel&rdquo; (2 Kin. 14:25). It was also a time of peace with both Judah (cf. 5:5) and her more distant neighbors; the ever-present menace of Assyria was subdued earlier that century because of Nineveh&rsquo;s repentance at the preaching of Jonah (Jon. 3:10). Spiritually, however, it was a time of rampant corruption and moral decay (4:1; 5:10&ndash;13; 2 Kin. 14:24).</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>Amos addresses Israel&rsquo;s two primary sins: 1) an absence of true worship, and 2) a lack of justice. In the midst of their ritualistic performance of worship, they were not pursuing the Lord with their hearts (4:4,5; 5:4&ndash;6) nor following His standard of justice with their neighbors (5:10&ndash;13; 6:12). This apostasy, evidenced by continual, willful rejection of the prophetic message of Amos, is promised divine judgment. Because of His covenant, however, the Lord will not abandon Israel altogether, but will bring future restoration to the righteous remnant (9:7&ndash;15).</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>In 9:11, the Lord promised that He &ldquo;will raise up the tabernacle of David, which has fallen down.&rdquo; At the Jerusalem Council, convened to discuss whether Gentiles should be allowed into the church without requiring circumcision, James quotes this passage (Acts 15:15,16) to support Peter&rsquo;s report of how God had &ldquo;visited the Gentiles to take out of them a people for His name&rdquo; (Acts 15:14). Some have thus concluded that the passage was fulfilled in Jesus, the greater Son of David, through whom the dynasty of David was reestablished. The Acts reference, however, is best seen as an illustration of Amos&rsquo; words and not the fulfillment. The temporal allusions to a future time (&ldquo;On that day,&rdquo; 9:11), when Israel will &ldquo;possess the remnant of Edom, and all the Gentiles&rdquo; (9:12), when the Lord &ldquo;will plant them in their land, and no longer shall they be pulled up from the land I have given them&rdquo; (9:15), all make it clear that the prophet is speaking of Messiah&rsquo;s return at the Second Advent to sit upon the throne of David (cf. Is. 9:7), not the establishment of the church by the apostles.</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I. Judgments Against the Nations (1:1&ndash;2:16)</strong></p><blockquote><p>A.

"31","31","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>The book is named after the prophet who received the vision (1:1). Obadiah means&ldquo;servant of the LORD&rdquo; and occurs 20 times in the OT, referring to at least 20 other OT individuals. Obadiah is the shortest book in the OT and is not quoted in the NT.</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>Nothing is known for certain about the author. Other OT references to men of this name do not appear to be referring to this prophet. His frequent mentions of Jerusalem, Judah, and Zion suggest that he belonged to the southern kingdom (cf. vv. 10&ndash;12,17,21). Obadiah was probably a contemporary of Elijah and Elisha.</p><p>The date of writing is equally difficult to determine, though we know it is tied to the Edomite assault on Jerusalem described in vv. 10&ndash;14. Obadiah apparently wrote shortly after the attack. There were 4 significant invasions of Jerusalem in OT history: 1) by Shishak, king of Egypt, ca. 925 B.C. during the reign of Rehoboam (1 Kin. 14:25,26; 2 Chr. 12); 2) by the Philistines and Arabians between 848&ndash;841 B.C. during the reign of Jehoram of Judah (2 Chr. 21:8&ndash;20); 3) by Jehoash, king of Israel, ca. 790 B.C. (2 Kin. 14; 2 Chr. 25); and 4) by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, in the fall of Jerusalem in 586 B.C. Of these 4, only the second and the fourth are possible fits with historical data. Number two is preferable, since Obadiah&rsquo;s description does not indicate the total destruction of the city, which took place under Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s attack. Also, although the Edomites were involved inNebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s destruction of Jerusalem (Ps. 137; Lam. 4:21), it is significant that Obadiah does not mention the Babylonians by name (as with all the other prophets who wrote about Jerusalem&rsquo;s fall), nor is there any reference to the destruction of the temple or the deportation of the people; in fact, the captives appear to have been taken to the SW, not E to Babylon (cf. v. 20).</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>The Edomites trace their origin to Esau, the firstborn (twin) son of Isaac and Rebekah (Gen. 25:24&ndash;26), who struggled with Jacob even while in the womb (Gen. 25:22). Esau&rsquo;s name means &ldquo;hairy,&rdquo; because &ldquo;he was like a hairy garment all over&rdquo; (Gen. 25:25). He is also called Edom, meaning &ldquo;red,&rdquo; owing to the sale of his birthright in exchange for some &ldquo;red stew&rdquo; (Gen. 25:30). He showed a disregard for the covenant promises by marrying two Canaanite women (Gen. 26:34) and later the daughter of Ishmael (Gen. 28:9). He loved the out-of-doors and, after having his father&rsquo;s blessing stolen from him by Jacob, was destined to remain a man of the open spaces (Gen. 25:27; 27:38&ndash;40). Esau settled in a region of mostly rugged mountains S of the Dead Sea (Gen. 33:16; 36:8,9; Deut. 2:4,5) called Edom (Gr., &ldquo;Idumea&rdquo;), the 40 mi. wide area which stretches approximately 100 mi. S to the Gulf of Aqabah. The fabled King&rsquo;s Highway, an essential caravan route linking North Africa with Europe and Asia, passes along the eastern plateau (Num. 20:17). The struggle and birth of Jacob and Esau (Gen. 25) form the ultimate background to the prophecy of Gen. 25:23, &ldquo;two nations are in your womb.&rdquo; Their respective descendants, Israel and Edom, were perpetual enemies. When Israel came out from Egypt, Edom denied their brother Jacob passage through their land, located S of the Dead Sea (Num. 20:14&ndash;21). Nevertheless, Israel was instructed by God to be kind to Edom (Deut. 23:7,8). Obadiah, having received a vision from God, was sent to describe their crimes and to pronounce total destruction upon Edom because of their treatment of Israel.</p><p>The Edomites opposed Saul (ca. 1043&ndash;1011 B.C.) and were subdued under David (ca. 1011&ndash;971 B.C.) and Solomon (ca. 971&ndash;931 B.C.). They fought against Jehoshaphat (ca. 873&ndash;848 B.C.) and successfully rebelled against Jehoram (ca. 853&ndash;841 B.C.). They were again conquered by Judah under Amaziah (ca. 796&ndash;767 B.C.), but they regained their freedom during the reign of Ahaz (ca. 735&ndash;715 B.C.). Edom was later controlled by Assyria and Babylon; and in the fifth century B.C. the Edomites were forced by the Nabateans to leave their territory. They moved to the area of southern Palestine and became known as Idumeans. Herod the Great, an Idumean, became king of Judea under Rome in 37 B.C. In a sense, the enmity between Esau and Jacob was continued in Herod&rsquo;s attempt to murder Jesus. The Idumeans participated in the rebellion of Jerusalem against Rome and were defeated along with the Jews by Titus in A.D. 70. Ironically, the Edomites applauded the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 B.C. (cf. Ps. 137:7) but died trying to defend it in A.D. 70. After that time they were never heard of again. As Obadiah predicted, they would be &ldquo;cut off forever&rdquo; (v. 10); &ldquo;and no survivor shall remain of the house of Esau&rdquo; (v. 18).</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>The book is a case study of Gen. 12:1&ndash;3, with two interrelated themes: 1) the judgment of Edom by God for cursing Israel. This was apparently told to Judah, thereby providing reassurance to Judah that the Day of the Lord (v. 15) would bring judgment upon Edom for her pride and for her participation in Judah&rsquo;s downfall; 2) Judah&rsquo;s restoration. This would even include the territory of the Edomites (vv. 19&ndash;21; Is. 11:14). Obadiah&rsquo;s blessing includes the near fulfillment of Edom&rsquo;s demise (vv. 1&ndash;15) under the assault of the Philistines and Arabians (2 Chr. 21:8&ndash;20) and the far fulfillment of the nation&rsquo;s judgment in the first century A.D. and Israel&rsquo;s final possession of Edom (vv. 15&ndash;21).</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>The striking similarity between Obad. 1&ndash;9 and Jer. 49:7&ndash;22 brings up the question: Who borrowed from whom? Assuming there was not a third common source, it appears that Jeremiah borrowed, where appropriate, from Obadiah, since the shared verses form one unit in Obadiah, while in Jeremiah they are scattered among other verses.</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I.

"32","32","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>Following the lead of the Hebrew Masoretic text (MT), the title of the book is derived from the principal character, Jonah (meaning &ldquo;dove&rdquo;), the son of Amittai (1:1). Both the Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate ascribe the same name.</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>The book makes no direct claim regarding authorship. Throughout the book, Jonah is repeatedly referred to in the third person, causing some to search for another author. It was not an uncommon OT practice, however, to write in the third person (e.g., Ex. 11:3; 1 Sam. 12:11). Furthermore, the autobiographical information revealed within its pages clearly points to Jonah as the author. The firsthand accounts of such unusual events and experiences would be best recounted from the hand of Jonah himself. Nor should the introductory verse suggest otherwise, since other prophets such as Hosea, Joel, Micah, Zephaniah, Haggai, and Zechariah have similar openings.</p><p>According to 2 Kin. 14:25, Jonah came from Gath-hepher near Nazareth. The context places him during the long and prosperous reign of Jeroboam II (ca. 793&ndash;758 B.C.), making him a prophet to the northern tribes just prior to Amos during the first half of the eighth century B.C., ca. 760 B.C. The Pharisees were wrong when they said &ldquo;no prophet has arisen out of Galilee&rdquo; (John 7:52), because Jonah was a Galilean. An unverifiable Jewish tradition says Jonah was the son of the widow of Zarephath whom Elijah raised from the dead (1 Kin. 17:8&ndash;<br />24).</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>As a prophet to the 10 northern tribes of Israel, Jonah shares a background and setting with Amos. The nation enjoyed a time of relative peace and prosperity. Both Syria and Assyriawere weak, allowing Jeroboam II to enlarge the northern borders of Israel to where they had been in the days of David and Solomon (2 Kin. 14:23&ndash;27). Spiritually, however, it was a time of poverty; religion was ritualistic and increasingly idolatrous, and justice had become perverted. Peacetime and wealth had made her bankrupt spiritually, morally, and ethically (cf.<br />2 Kin. 14:24; Amos 4:1ff.; 5:10&ndash;13). As a result, God was to punish her by bringing destruction and captivity from the Assyrians in 722 B.C. Nineveh&rsquo;s repentance may have been aided by the two plagues (765 and 759 B.C.) and a solar eclipse (763 B.C.), preparing them for Jonah&rsquo;s judgment message.</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>Jonah, though a prophet of Israel, is not remembered for his ministry in Israel which could explain why the Pharisees erringly claimed in Jesus&rsquo; day that no prophet had come from Galilee (cf. John 7:52). Rather, the book relates the account of his call to preach repentance to Nineveh and his refusal to go. Nineveh, the capital of Assyria and infamous for its cruelty, was an historical nemesis of Israel and Judah. The focus of this book is on that Gentile city, which was founded by Nimrod, great-grandson of Noah (Gen. 10:6&ndash;12). Perhaps the largest city in the ancient world (1:2; 3:2,3; 4:11), it was nevertheless destroyed about 150 years after the repentance of the generation in the time of Jonah&rsquo;s visit (612 B.C.), as Nahum prophesied (Nah. 1:1ff.). Israel&rsquo;s political distaste for Assyria, coupled with a sense of spiritual superiority as the recipient of God&rsquo;s covenant blessing, produced a recalcitrant attitude in Jonah toward God&rsquo;s request for missionary service. Jonah was sent to Nineveh in part to shame Israel by the fact that a pagan city repented at the preaching of a stranger, whereas Israel would not repent though preached to by many prophets. He was soon to learn that God&rsquo;s love and mercy extends to all of His creatures (4:2,10,11), not just His covenant people (cf. Gen. 9:27; 12:3; Lev. 19:33,34; 1 Sam. 2:10; Is. 2:2; Joel 2:28&ndash;32).</p><p>The book of Jonah reveals God&rsquo;s sovereign rule over man and all creation. Creation came into being through Him (1:9) and responds to His every command (1:4,17; 2:10; 4:6,7; cf. Mark 4:41). Jesus employed the repentance of the Ninevites to rebuke the Pharisees, thereby illustrating the hardness of the Pharisees&rsquo; hearts and their unwillingness to repent (Matt. 12:38&ndash;41; Luke 11:29&ndash;32). The heathen city of Nineveh repented at the preaching of a reluctant prophet, but the Pharisees would not repent at the preaching of the greatest of all prophets, in spite of overwhelming evidence that He was actually their Lord and Messiah. Jonah is a picture of Israel, who was chosen and commissioned by God to be His witness (Is. 43:10&ndash;12; 44:8), who rebelled against His will (Ex. 32:1&ndash;4; Judg. 2:11&ndash;19; Ezek. 6:1&ndash;5; Mark 7:6&ndash;9), but who has been miraculously preserved by God through centuries of exile and dispersion to finally preach His truth (Jer. 30:11; 31:35&ndash;37; Hos. 3:3&ndash;5; Rev. 7:1&ndash;8; 14:1&ndash;3).</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>The primary challenge is whether the book is to be interpreted as historical narrative or as allegory/parable. The grand scale of the miracles, such as being kept alive 3 days and nights in a big fish, has led some skeptics and critics to deny their historical validity and substitute spiritual lessons, either to the constituent parts (allegory) or to the book as a whole (parable). But however grandiose and miraculous the events may have been, the narrative must be viewed as historical. Centered on an historically identifiable OT prophet who lived in the eighth century B.C., the account of whom has been recorded in narrative form, there is no alternative but to understand Jonah as historical. Furthermore, Jesus did not teach the story of Jonah as a parable but as an actual account firmly rooted in history (Matt. 12:38&ndash;41; 16:4; Luke 11:29&ndash;32).</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I.

"33","33","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>The name of the book is derived from the prophet who, having received the word of the Lord, was commissioned to proclaim it. Micah, whose name is shared by others in the OT (e.g., Judg. 17:1; 2 Chr. 13:2; Jer. 36:11), is a shortened form of Micaiah (or Michaiah) and means &ldquo;Who is like the LORD?&rdquo; In 7:18, Micah uses a play on his own name, saying &ldquo;Who is a God like You?&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>The first verse establishes Micah as the author. Beyond that, little is known about him. His parentage is not given, but his name suggests a godly heritage. He traces his roots to the town of Moresheth (1:1,14), located in the foothills of Judah, approximately 25 mi. SW of Jerusalem, on the border of Judah and Philistia, near Gath. From a productive agricultural area, he was like Amos, a country resident removed from the national politics and religion, yet chosen by God (3:8) to deliver a message of judgment to the princes and people of Jerusalem. Micah places his prophecy during the reigns of Jotham (750&ndash;731 B.C.), Ahaz (731&ndash;715 B.C.), and Hezekiah (715&ndash;686 B.C.). His indictments of social injustices and religious corruption renew the theme of Amos (mid-eighth century B.C.) and his contemporaries, Hosea in the N (ca. 755&ndash;710 B.C.) and in the S Isaiah (ca. 739&ndash;690 B.C.). This fits that which is known about the character of Ahaz (2 Kin. 16:10&ndash;18) and his son Hezekiah prior to his sweeping spiritual reformations (2 Chr. 29; 31:1). His references to the imminent fall of Samaria (1:6) clearly position him before 722 B.C., at approximately 735&ndash;710 B.C.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>Because the northern kingdom was about to fall to Assyria during Micah&rsquo;s ministry in 722 B.C., Micah dates his message with the mention of Judean kings only. While Israel was an occasional recipient of his words (cf. 1:5&ndash;7), his primary attention was directed toward the southern kingdom in which he lived. The economic prosperity and the absence of international crises which marked the days of Jeroboam II (793&ndash;753 B.C.), during which the borders of Judah and Israel rivaled those of David and Solomon (cf. 2 Kin. 14:23&ndash;27), were slipping away. Syria and Israel invaded Judah, taking the wicked Ahaz temporarily captive (cf. 2 Chr. 28:5&ndash;16; Is. 7:1,2). After Assyria had overthrown Syria and Israel, the good king Hezekiah withdrew his allegiance to Assyria, causing Sennacherib to besiege Jerusalem in 701 B.C. (cf. 2 Kin. 18,19; 2 Chr. 32). The Lord then sent His angel to deliver Judah (2 Chr. 32:21). Hezekiah was used by God to lead Judah back to true worship.</p><p>After the prosperous reign of Uzziah, who died in 739 B.C., his son Jotham continued the same policies, but failed to remove the centers of idolatry. Outward prosperity was only a facade masking rampant social corruption and religious syncretism. Worship of the Canaanite fertility god Baal was increasingly integrated with the OT sacrificial system, reaching epidemic proportions under the reign of Ahaz (cf. 2 Chr. 28:1&ndash;4). When Samaria fell, thousands of refugees swarmed into Judah, bringing their religious syncretism with them. But while Micah (like Hosea) addressed this issue, it was the disintegration of personal and social values to which he delivered his most stinging rebukes and stern warnings (e.g., 7:5,6). Assyria was the dominant power and a constant threat to Judah, so Micah&rsquo;s prediction that Babylon, then under Assyrian rule, would conquer Judah (4:10) seemed remote. Thus, as the prophet Amos was to Israel, Micah was to Judah.</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>Primarily, Micah proclaimed a message of judgment to a people persistently pursuing evil. Similar to other prophets (cf. Hos. 4:1; Amos 3:1), Micah presented his message in lawsuit/courtroom terminology (1:2; 6:1,2). The prophecy is arranged in 3 oracles or cycles, each beginning with the admonition to &ldquo;hear&rdquo; (1:2; 3:1; 6:1). Within each oracle, he moves from doom to hope&mdash;doom because they have broken God&rsquo;s law given at Sinai; hope because of God&rsquo;s unchanging covenant with their forefathers (7:20). One third of the book targets the sins of his people; another third looks at the punishment of God to come; and another third promises hope for the faithful after the judgment. Thus, the theme of the inevitability of divine judgment for sin is coupled together with God&rsquo;s immutable commitment to His covenant promises. The combination of God&rsquo;s 1) absolute consistency in judging sin and 2) unbending commitment to His covenant through the remnant of His people provides the hearers with a clear disclosure of the character of the Sovereign of the universe. Through divine intervention, He will bring about both judgment on sinners and blessing on those who repent.</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>The verbal similarity between Mic. 4:1&ndash;3 and Is. 2:2&ndash;4 raises the question of who quoted whom. Interpreters are divided, with no clear-cut answers on either side. Because the two prophets lived in close proximity to each other, prophesying during the same period, this similarity is understandable. God gave the same message through two preachers. The introductory phrase, &ldquo;in the latter days&rdquo; (4:1), removes these verses from any post-Exilic fulfillment and requires an eschatological timeframe surrounding the Second Advent of Christ and the beginning of the Millennium.</p><p>Apart from Is. 2:2&ndash;4, three other passages from Micah are quoted elsewhere in Scripture. Micah 3:12 is quoted in Jer. 26:18, thereby saving Jeremiah&rsquo;s life from King Jehoiakim&rsquo;s death sentence. Micah 5:2 is quoted by the chief priests and scribes (Matt. 2:6) in response to Herod&rsquo;s query about the birthplace of the Messiah. Micah 7:6 is employed by Jesus in Matt. 10:35,36 when commissioning His disciples.</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I. Superscription (1:1)</strong></p><p><strong>II.

"34","34","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>The book&rsquo;s title is taken from the prophet of God&rsquo;s oracle against Nineveh, the capital of Assyria. Nahum means &ldquo;comfort&rdquo; or &ldquo;consolation&rdquo; and is a short form of Nehemiah (&ldquo;comfort of Yahweh&rdquo;). Nahum is not quoted in the NT, although there may be an allusion to Nah. 1:15 in Rom. 10:15 (cf. Is. 52:7).</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>The significance of the writing prophets was not their personal lives; it was their message. Thus, background information about the prophet from within the prophecy is rare. Occasionally one of the historical books will shed additional light. In the case of Nahum, nothing is provided except that he was an Elkoshite (1:1), referring either to his birthplace or his place of ministry. Attempts to identify the location of Elkosh have been unsuccessful. Suggestions include Al Qosh, situated in northern Iraq (thus Nahum would have been a descendant of the exiles taken to Assyria in 722 B.C.), Capernaum (&ldquo;town of Nahum&rdquo;), or a location in southern Judah (cf. 1:15). His birthplace or locale is not significant to the interpretation of the book.</p><p>With no mention of any kings in the introduction, the date of Nahum&rsquo;s prophecy must be implied by historical data. The message of judgment against Nineveh portrays a nation of strength, intimating a time not only prior to her fall in 612 B.C. but probably before the death of Ashurbanipal in 626 B.C., after which Assyria&rsquo;s power fell rapidly. Nahum&rsquo;s mention of the fall of No Amon, also called Thebes (3:8&ndash;10), in 663 B.C. (at the hands of Ashurbanipal) appears to be fresh in their minds and there is no mention of the rekindling that occurred ten years later, suggesting a mid-seventh century B.C. date during the reign of Manasseh (ca. 695&ndash;642 B.C.; cf. 2 Kin. 21:1&ndash;18).</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>A century after Nineveh repented at the preaching of Jonah, she returned to idolatry, violence, and arrogance (3:1&ndash;4). Assyria was at the height of her power, having recovered from Sennacherib&rsquo;s defeat (701 B.C.) at Jerusalem (cf. Is. 37:36&ndash;38). Her borders extended all the way into Egypt. Esarhaddon had recently transplanted conquered peoples into Samaria and Galilee in 670 B.C. (cf. 2 Kin. 17:24; Ezra 4:2), leaving Syria and Palestine very weak. But God brought Nineveh down under the rising power of Babylon&rsquo;s king Nabopolassar and his son, Nebuchadnezzar (ca. 612 B.C.). Assyria&rsquo;s demise turned out just as God had prophesied.</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>Nahum forms a sequel to the book of Jonah, who prophesied over a century earlier. Jonah recounts the remission of God&rsquo;s promised judgment toward Nineveh, while Nahum depicts the later execution of God&rsquo;s judgment. Nineveh was proud of her invulnerable city, with her walls reaching 100 ft. high and with a moat 150 ft. wide and 60 ft. deep; but Nahum established the fact that the sovereign God (1:2&ndash;5) would bring vengeance upon those who violated His law (1:8,14; 3:5&ndash;7). The same God had a retributive judgment against evil which is also redemptive, bestowing His loving kindnesses upon the faithful (cf. 1:7,12,13,15; 2:2). The prophecy brought comfort to Judah and all who feared the cruel Assyrians. Nahum said Nineveh would end &ldquo;with an overflowing flood&rdquo; (1:8); and it happened when the Tigris River overflowed to destroy enough of the walls to let the Babylonians through. Nahum also predicted that the city would be hidden (3:11). After its destruction in 612 B.C., the site was not rediscovered until 1842 A.D.</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>Apart from the uncertain identity of Elkosh (cf. Introduction: Author and Date), the prophecy presents no real interpretive difficulties.

"35","35","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>This prophetic book takes its name from its author and possibly means &ldquo;one who embraces&rdquo; (1:1; 3:1). By the end of the prophecy, this name becomes appropriate as the prophet clings to God regardless of his confusion about God&rsquo;s plans for his people.</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>As with many of the Minor Prophets, nothing is known about the prophet except that which can be inferred from the book. In the case of Habakkuk, internal information is virtually nonexistent, making conclusions about his identity and life conjectural. His simple introduction as &ldquo;the prophet Habakkuk&rdquo; may imply that he needed no introduction since he was a well known prophet of his day. It is certain that he was a contemporary of Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, and Zephaniah.</p><p>The mention of the Chaldeans (1:6) suggests a late seventh century B.C. date, shortly before Nebuchadnezzar commenced his military march through Nineveh (612 B.C.), Haran (609 B.C.), and Carchemish (605 B.C.), on his way to Jerusalem (605 B.C.). Habakkuk&rsquo;s bitter lament (1:2&ndash;4) may reflect a time period shortly after the death of Josiah (609 B.C.), days in which the godly king&rsquo;s reforms (cf. 2 Kin. 23) were quickly overturned by his successor, Jehoiakim (Jer. 22:13&ndash;19).</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>Habakkuk prophesied during the final days of the Assyrian Empire and the beginning of Babylonia&rsquo;s world rulership under Nabopolassar and his son Nebuchadnezzar. When Nabopolassar ascended to power in 626 B.C., he immediately began to expand his influence to the N and W. Under the leadership of his son, the Babylonian army overthrew Nineveh in 612 B.C., forcing the Assyrian nobility to take refuge first in Haran and then Carchemish. Nebuchadnezzar pursued them, overrunning Haran in 609 B.C. and Carchemish in 606 B.C.</p><p>The Egyptian king Necho, traveling through Judah in 609 B.C. to assist the fleeing Assyrian king, was opposed by King Josiah at Megiddo (2 Chr. 35:20&ndash;24). Josiah was killed in the ensuing battle, leaving his throne to a succession of 3 sons and a grandson. Earlier, as a result of discovering the Book of the Law in the temple (622 B.C.), Josiah had instituted significant spiritual reforms in Judah (2 Kin. 22,23), abolishing many of the idolatrous practices of his father Amon (2 Kin. 21:20&ndash;22) and grandfather Manasseh (2 Kin. 21:11&ndash;13). Upon his death, however, the nation quickly reverted to her evil ways (cf. Jer. 22:13&ndash;19), causing Habakkuk to question God&rsquo;s silence and apparent lack of punitive action (1:2&ndash;4) to purge His covenant people.</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>The opening verses reveal a historical situation similar to the days of Amos and Micah.Justice had essentially disappeared from the Land; violence and wickedness were pervasive, existing unchecked. In the midst of these dark days, the prophet cried out for divine intervention (1:2&ndash;4). God&rsquo;s response, that He was sending the Chaldeans to judge Judah (1:5&ndash;11), creates an even greater theological dilemma for Habakkuk: Why didn&rsquo;t God purge His people and restore their righteousness? How could God use the Chaldeans to judge a people more righteous than they (1:12&ndash;2:1)? God&rsquo;s answer that He would judge the Chaldeans also (2:2&ndash;20), did not fully satisfy the prophet&rsquo;s theological quandary; in fact, it only intensified it. In Habakkuk&rsquo;s mind, the issue crying for resolution is no longer God&rsquo;s righteous response toward evil (or lack thereof), but the vindication of God&rsquo;s character and covenant with His people (1:13). Like Job, the prophet argued with God, and through that experience he achieved a deeper understanding of God&rsquo;s sovereign character and a firmer faith in Him (cf. Job 42:5,6; Is. 55:8,9). Ultimately, Habakkuk realized that God was not to be worshiped merely because of the temporal blessings He bestowed, but for His own sake (3:17&ndash;19).</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>The queries of the prophet represent some of the most fundamental questions in all of life, with the answers providing crucial foundation stones on which to build a proper understanding of God&rsquo;s character and His sovereign ways in history. The core of his message lies in the call to trust God (2:4), &ldquo;the just shall live by his faith.&rdquo; The NT references ascribe unusual importance theologically to Habakkuk. The writer of Hebrews quotes Hab. 2:4 to amplify the believer&rsquo;s need to remain strong and faithful in the midst of affliction and trials (Heb. 10:38). The apostle Paul, on the other hand, employs the verse twice (Rom. 1:17; Gal. 3:11) to accentuate the doctrine of justification by faith. There need not be any interpretive conflict, however, for the emphasis in both Habakkuk and the NT references goes beyond the act of faith to include the continuity of faith. Faith is not a one-time act, but a way of life. The true believer, declared righteous by God, will habitually persevere in faith throughout all his life (cf. Col. 1:22,23; Heb. 3:12&ndash;14). He will trust the sovereign God who only does what is right.</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I. Superscription (1:1)</strong></p><p><strong>II.

"36","36","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>As with each of the 12 Minor Prophets, the prophecy bears the name of its author, which is generally thought to mean &ldquo;the LORD hides&rdquo; (cf. 2:3).</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>Little is known about the author, Zephaniah. Three other OT individuals share his name. He traces his genealogy back 4 generations to King Hezekiah (ca. 715&ndash;686 B.C.), standing alone among the prophets descended from royal blood (1:1). Royal genealogy would have given him the ear of Judah&rsquo;s king, Josiah, during whose reign he preached. The prophet himself dates his message during the reign of Josiah (640&ndash;609 B.C.). The moral and spiritual conditions detailed in the book (cf. 1:4&ndash;6; 3:1&ndash;7) seem to place the prophecy prior to Josiah&rsquo;s reforms, when Judah was still languishing in idolatry and wickedness. It was in 628 B.C. that Josiah tore down all the altars to Baal, burned the bones of false prophets, and broke the carved idols (2 Chr. 34:3&ndash;7); and in 622 B.C. the Book of the Law was found (2 Chr. 34:8&ndash;35:19). Consequently, Zephaniah most likely prophesied from 635&ndash;625 B.C., and was a contemporary of Jeremiah.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>Politically, the imminent transfer of Assyrian world power to the Babylonians weakened Nineveh&rsquo;s hold on Judah, bringing an element of independence to Judah for the first time in 50 years. King Josiah&rsquo;s desire to retain this newfound freedom from taxation and subservience undoubtedly led him to interfere later with Egypt&rsquo;s attempt to interdict the fleeing king of Nineveh in 609 B.C. (cf. 2 Chr. 35:20&ndash;27). Spiritually, the reigns of Hezekiah&rsquo;s son Manasseh (ca. 695&ndash;642 B.C.), extending over 4 decades, and his grandson Amon (ca. 642&ndash;640 B.C.), lasting only two years, were marked by wickedness and apostasy (2 Kin. 21; 2 Chr. 33). The early years of Josiah&rsquo;s reign were also characterized by the evil from his fathers (2 Kin. 23:4). In 622 B.C., however, while repairing the house of the Lord, Hilkiah the High-Priest found the Book of the Law (2 Kin. 22:8). Upon reading it, Josiah initiated extensive reforms (2 Kin. 23). It was during the early years of Josiah&rsquo;s reign, prior to the great revival, that this 11th hour prophet, Zephaniah, prophesied and no doubt had an influence on the sweeping reforms Josiah brought to the nation. But the evil kings before Josiah (55 years) had had such an effect on Judah that it never recovered. Josiah&rsquo;s reforms were too late and didn&rsquo;t outlast his life.</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>Zephaniah&rsquo;s message on the Day of the Lord warned Judah that the final days were near, through divine judgment at the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, ca. 605&ndash;586 B.C. (1:4&ndash;13). Yet, it also looks beyond to the far fulfillment in the judgments of Daniel&rsquo;s 70th week (1:18; 3:8). The expression &ldquo;Day of the Lord&rdquo; is employed by the author more often than by any other OT writer, and is described as a day that is near (1:7), and as a day of wrath, trouble, distress, devastation, desolation, darkness, gloominess, clouds, thick darkness, trumpet, and alarm (1:15,16,18). Yet even within these oracles of divine wrath, the prophet exhorted the people to seek the Lord, offering a shelter in the midst of judgment (2:3), and proclaiming the promise of eventual salvation for His believing remnant (2:7; 3:9&ndash;20).</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>The book presents an unambiguous denunciation of sin and warning of imminent judgment on Judah. Some have referred the phrase &ldquo;I will restore to the peoples a pure language&rdquo; (3:9) to the restoration of a universal language, similar to the days prior to confusion of languages at the Tower of Babel (Gen. 11:1&ndash;9). They point out that the word &ldquo;language&rdquo; is also used in Gen. 11:7. It is better, however, to understand the passage as pointing to a purification of heart and life. This is confirmed by the context (cf. 3:13) and corroborated by the fact that the word &ldquo;language&rdquo; is most commonly translated &ldquo;lip.&rdquo; When combined with &ldquo;pure,&rdquo; the reference to speech speaks of inward cleansing from sin (Is. 6:5) manifested in speech (cf. Matt. 12:34), including the removal of the names of false gods from their lips (Hos. 2:17). It does not imply a one world language.</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I.

"37","37","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>The prophecy bears the name of its author. Because his name means &ldquo;festal one,&rdquo; it is suggested that Haggai was born on a feast day. Haggai is the second shortest book in the OT (Obadiah is shorter) and is quoted by the NT once (cf. Heb. 12:26).</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>Little is known about Haggai apart from this short prophecy. He is mentioned briefly in Ezra 5:1 and 6:14, on both occasions in conjunction with the prophet Zechariah. The lists of refugees in Ezra mention nothing of Haggai; there are no indications of his parentage or tribal ancestry. Nor does history provide any record of his occupation. He is the only person in the OT with the name, although similar names occur (cf. Gen. 46:16; Num. 26:15; 2 Sam. 3:4; 1 Chr. 6:30). Furthermore, Hag. 2:3 may suggest that he too had seen the glory of Solomon&rsquo;s temple before it was destroyed, making him at least 70 years of age when writing his prophecy. There is no ambiguity or controversy about the date of the prophecy. The occasion of each of his 4 prophecies is clearly specified (1:1; 2:1; 2:10; 2:20), occurring within a 4 month span of time in the second year (ca. 520 B.C.) of Persian king Darius Hystaspes (ca. 521&ndash;486 B.C.). Haggai most likely had returned to Jerusalem from Babylon with Zerubbabel 18 years earlier in 538 B.C.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>In 538 B.C., as a result of the proclamation of Cyrus the Persian (cf. Ezra 1:1&ndash;4), Israel was allowed to return from Babylon to her homeland under the civil leadership of Zerubbabel and the spiritual guidance of Joshua the High-Priest (cf. Ezra 3:2). About 50,000 Jews returned. In 536 B.C., they began to rebuild the temple (cf. Ezra 3:1&ndash;4:5) but opposition from neighbors and indifference by the Jews caused the work to be abandoned (cf. Ezra 4:1&ndash;24). Sixteen years later Haggai and Zechariah were commissioned by the Lord to stir up the people to 1) not only rebuild the temple, but also to 2) reorder their spiritual priorities (cf. Ezra 5:1&ndash;6:22). As a result, the temple was completed 4 years later (ca. 516 B.C.; cf. Ezra 6:15).</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>The primary theme is the rebuilding of God&rsquo;s temple, which had been lying in ruins since its destruction by Nebuchadnezzar in 586 B.C. By means of 5 messages from the Lord, Haggai exhorted the people to renew their efforts to build the house of the Lord. He motivated them by noting that the drought and crop failures were caused by misplaced spiritual priorities (1:9&ndash;11). But to Haggai, the rebuilding of the temple was not an end in itself. The temple represented God&rsquo;s dwelling place, His manifest presence with His chosen people. The destruction of the temple by Nebuchadnezzar followed the departure of God&rsquo;s dwelling glory (cf. Ezek. 8&ndash;11); to the prophet, the rebuilding of the temple invited the return of God&rsquo;s presence to their midst. Using the historical situation as a springboard, Haggai reveled in the supreme glory of the ultimate messianic temple yet to come (2:7), encouraging them with the promise of even greater peace (2:9), prosperity (2:19), divine rulership (2:21,22), and national blessing (2:23) during the Millennium.</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>The most prominent interpretive ambiguity within the prophecy is the phrase &ldquo;the Desire of All Nations&rdquo; (2:7). Although many translations exist, there are essentially only two interpretations. Pointing to &ldquo;The silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine&rdquo; (2:8), as well as to Is. 60:5 and Zech. 14:14, some contend that it refers to Jerusalem, to which the wealth of other nations will be brought during the Millennium (cf. Is. 60:11; 61:6). It seems preferable, however, to see a reference here to the Messiah, a Deliverer for whom all the nations ultimately long. Not only is this interpretation supported by the ancient rabbis and the early church, the mention of &ldquo;glory&rdquo; in the latter part of the verse suggests a personal reference to the Messiah (cf. Is. 40:5; 60:1; Luke 2:32).</p><p><strong>Outline and Chronology</strong></p><table border=""0"" width=""100%""><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>Year</strong></td><td><strong>Month</strong></td><td><strong>Day</strong></td></tr><tr><td>I.

"38","38","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>The universal tradition of both Jews and Christians endorses the prophet Zechariah as author. His name, common to more than 29 OT men, means &ldquo;The LORD remembers.&rdquo; This book is second only to Isaiah in the breadth of the prophet&rsquo;s writings about Messiah.</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>Like Jeremiah and Ezekiel, Zechariah was also a priest (Neh. 12:12&ndash;16) According to tradition, he was a member of the Great Synagogue, a council of 120 originated by Nehemiah and presided over by Ezra. This council later developed into the ruling elders of the nation, called the Sanhedrin. He was born in Babylon and joined his grandfather, Iddo, in the group of exiles who first returned to Jerusalem under the leadership of Zerubbabel and Joshua the High-Priest (cf. Neh. 12:4). Because he is occasionally mentioned as the son of his grandfather (cf. Ezra 5:1; 6:14; Neh. 12:16), it is thought that his father, Berechiah, died at an early age before he could succeed his father into the priesthood.</p><p>Zechariah&rsquo;s opening words are dated from 520 B.C., the second year of Darius I (cf. 1:1). The Persian emperor Cyrus had died and was succeeded by Cambyses (ca. 530&ndash;521 B.C.) who conquered Egypt. He had no son, he killed himself, and Darius rose to the throne by quelling a revolution. He was a contemporary of Haggai, and began his prophesying 2 months after him (cf. Haggai Introduction). He is called a young man in 2:4, suggesting that Zechariah was younger than Haggai. The length of his ministry is uncertain; the last dated prophecy (7:1) came approximately two years after the first, making them identical in time with Haggai&rsquo;s prophecy (520&ndash;518 B.C.). Chapters 9&ndash;14 are generally thought to come from a later period of his ministry. Differences in style and references to Greece indicate a date of ca. 480&ndash;470 B.C., after Darius I (ca. 521&ndash;486 B.C.) and during Xerxes&rsquo; reign (ca. 486&ndash;464 B.C.), the king who made Esther queen of Persia. According to Matt. 23:35, he was murdered between the temple and the altar, a fate similar to an earlier Zechariah (cf. 2 Chr. 24:20,21), who had been stoned to death.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>The historical background and setting of Zechariah are the same as that of his contemporary, Haggai (cf. <a href=""http://www.gty.org/resources/Resources/Bible+Introductions/MSB37"">Haggai Introduction</a>). In 538 B.C., Cyrus the Persian freed the captives from Israel to resettle their homeland (cf. Ezra 1:1&ndash;4) and about 50,000 returned from Babylon. They immediately began to rebuild the temple (cf. Ezra 3:1&ndash;4:5), but opposition from neighbors, followed by indifference from within, caused the work to be abandoned (cf. Ezra 4:24). Sixteen years later (cf. Ezra 5:1,2), Zechariah and Haggai were commissioned by the Lord to stir up the people to rebuild the temple. As a result, the temple was completed 4 years later in 516 B.C. (Ezra 6:15).</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>Zechariah joined Haggai in rousing the people from their indifference, challenging them to resume the building of the temple. Haggai&rsquo;s primary purpose was to rebuild the temple; his preaching has a tone of rebuke for the people&rsquo;s indifference, sin, and lack of trust in God. He was used to start the revival, while Zechariah was used to keep it going strong with a more positive emphasis, calling the people to repentance and reassuring them regarding future blessings. Zechariah sought to encourage the people to build the temple in view of the promise that someday Messiah would come to inhabit it. The people were not just building for the present, but with the future hope of Messiah in mind. He encouraged the people, still downtrodden by the Gentile powers (1:8&ndash;12), with the reality that the Lord remembers His covenant promises to them and that He would restore and bless them. Thus the name of the book (which means &ldquo;The LORD remembers&rdquo;) contains in seed form the theme of the prophecy.</p><p>This &ldquo;apocalypse of the OT&rdquo; as it is often called, relates both to Zechariah&rsquo;s immediate audience as well as to the future. This is borne out in the structure of the prophecy itself, since in each of the 3 major sections (chaps. 1&ndash;6,7,8,9&ndash;14), the prophet begins historically and then moves forward to the time of the Second Advent, when Messiah returns to His temple to set up His earthly kingdom. The prophet reminded the people that Messiah had both an immediate and long-term commitment to His people. Thus the prophet&rsquo;s words were &ldquo;good and comforting&rdquo; (1:13), both to the exiles of Zechariah&rsquo;s day as well as to the remnant of God&rsquo;s chosen people in that future day.</p><p>This book is the most messianic, apocalyptic, and eschatological in the OT. Primarily, it is a prophecy about Jesus Christ, focusing on His coming glory as a means to comfort Israel (cf. 1:13,17). While the book is filled with visions, prophecies, signs, celestial visitors, and the voice of God, it is also practical, dealing with issues like repentance, divine care, salvation, and holy living. Prophecy was soon to be silent for more than 400 years until John the Baptist, so God used Zechariah to bring a rich, abundant outburst of promise for the future to sustain the<br />faithful remnant through those silent years.</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>While there are numerous challenges to the reader, two passages within the prophecy present notable interpretive difficulty. In 11:8, the Good Shepherd &ldquo;dismissed the three shepherds in one month.&rdquo; The presence of the definite article points to familiarity, so that the Jews would have understood the identity of these shepherds without further reference. It is not so easy for modern readers to understand. Numerous alternatives concerning their identity have been suggested. One of the oldest, and probably the correct, view identifies them as three orders of leaders: the priests, elders, and scribes of Israel. During His earthly ministry, Jesus also confronted the hypocrisy of Israel&rsquo;s religious leaders (cf. Matt. 23), disowning them with scathing denunciations, followed by destruction of the whole nation in A.D. 70. Since His coming, the Jewish people have had no other prophet, priest, or king.</p><p>Considerable discussion also surrounds the identity of the individual who possessed &ldquo;wounds between your arms&rdquo; (13:6). Some have identified him with Christ, the wounds supposedly referring to His crucifixion. But Christ could neither have denied that He was a prophet, nor could He have claimed that He was a farmer, or that He was wounded in the house of His friends. Obviously, it is a reference to a false prophet (cf. vv. 4,5) who was wounded in his idolatrous worship. The zeal for the Lord will be so great in the kingdom of Messiah that idolaters will make every attempt to hide their true identity, but their scars will be the telltale evidence of their iniquity.</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I.

"39","39","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>The title is derived from the prophecy&rsquo;s author, Malachi. With this last work in the Minor Prophets, God closes the OT canon historically and prophetically.</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>Some have suggested that the book was written anonymously, noting that the name, meaning &ldquo;my messenger&rdquo; or &ldquo;the LORD&rsquo;s messenger,&rdquo; could be a title rather than a proper name. It is pointed out that the name occurs nowhere else in the OT, nor is any background material provided about the author. However, since all other prophetic books have historically identified their author in the introductory heading, this suggests that Malachi was indeed the name of the last OT writing prophet in Israel. Jewish tradition identifies him as a member of the Great Synagogue that collected and preserved the Scriptures.</p><p>Looking solely at internal evidence, the date of the prophecy points to the late fifth century B.C., most likely during Nehemiah&rsquo;s return to Persia ca. 433&ndash;424 B.C. (cf. Neh. 5:14; 13:6). Sacrifices were being made at the second temple (1:7&ndash;10; 3:8), which was finished in 516 B.C. (cf. Ezra 6:13&ndash;15). Many years had passed since then as the priests had increasingly become complacent and corrupt (1:6&ndash;2:9). Malachi&rsquo;s reference to &ldquo;governor&rdquo; (1:8) speaks of the time of Persian dominance in Judah when Nehemiah was revisiting Persia (Neh. 13:6), while his emphasis on the law (4:4) coincides with a similar focus by Ezra and Nehemiah (cf. Ezra 7:14,25,26; Neh. 8:18). They shared other concerns as well, such as marriages to foreign wives (2:11&ndash;15; cf. Ezra 9,10; Neh. 13:23&ndash;27), withholding of tithes (3:8&ndash;10; cf. Neh. 13:10&ndash;14), and social injustice (3:5; cf. Neh. 5:1&ndash;13). Nehemiah came to Jerusalem in 445 B.C. to rebuild the wall, and returned to Persia in 433 B.C. He later returned to Israel (ca. 424 B.C.) to deal with the sins Malachi described (Neh. 13:6). So it is likely that Malachi was written during the period of Nehemiah&rsquo;s absence, almost a century after Haggai and Zechariah began to prophesy. Similar to Rev. 2,3, in which Christ writes what He thinks about the conditions of the churches, here God writes through Malachi to impress upon Israel His thoughts about the nation.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>Only 50,000 exiles had returned to Judah from Babylon (538&ndash;536 B.C.). The temple had been rebuilt under the leadership of Zerubbabel (516 B.C.) and the sacrificial system renewed. Ezra had returned in 458 B.C., followed by Nehemiah in 445 B.C. After being back in the land of Palestine for only a century, the ritual of the Jews&rsquo; religious routine led to hard-heartedness toward God&rsquo;s great love for them and to widespread departure from His law by both people and priest. Malachi rebuked and condemned these abuses, forcefully indicting the people and calling them to repentance. When Nehemiah returned from Persia the second time (ca. 424 B.C.), he vigorously rebuked them for these abuses in the temple and priesthood, for the violation of the Sabbath rest, and for the unlawful divorce of their Jewish wives so they could marry Gentile women (cf. Neh. 13).</p><p>As over two millennia of OT history since Abraham concluded, none of the glorious promises of the Abrahamic, Davidic, and New Covenants had been fulfilled in their ultimate sense. Although there had been a few high points in Israel&rsquo;s history, e.g., Joshua, David, and Josiah, the Jews had seemingly lost all opportunity to receive God&rsquo;s favor since less than 100 years after returning from captivity, they had already sunk to a depth of sin that exceeded the former iniquities which brought on the Assyrian and Babylonian deportations. Beyond this, the long anticipated Messiah had not arrived and did not seem to be in sight.</p><p>So, Malachi wrote the capstone prophecy of the OT in which he delivered God&rsquo;s message of judgment on Israel for their continuing sin and God&rsquo;s promise that one day in the future, when the Jews would repent, Messiah would be revealed and God&rsquo;s covenant promises would be fulfilled. There were over 400 years of divine silence, with only Malachi&rsquo;s words ringing condemnation in their ears, before another prophet arrived with a message from God. That was John the Baptist preaching, &ldquo;Repent, for the Kingdom of heaven is at hand!&rdquo; (Matt. 3:2). Messiah had come.</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>The Lord repeatedly referred to His covenant with Israel (cf. 2:4,5,8,10,14; 3:1), reminding them, from His opening words, of their unfaithfulness to His love/marriage relationship with them (cf. 1:2&ndash;5). God&rsquo;s love for His people pervades the book. Apparently the promises by the former prophets of the coming Messiah who would bring final deliverance and age-long blessings, and the encouragement from the recent promises (ca. 500 B.C.) of Haggai and Zechariah, had only made the people and their leaders more resolute in their complacency. They thought that this love relationship could be maintained by formal ritual alone, no matter how they lived. In a penetrating rebuke of both priests (1:6&ndash;2:9) and people (2:10&ndash;16), the prophet reminds them that the Lord&rsquo;s coming, which they were seeking (3:1), would be in judgment to refine, purify, and purge (3:2,3). The Lord not only wanted outward compliance to the law, but an inward acceptance as well (cf. Matt. 23:23). The prophet assaults the corruption, wickedness, and false security by directing his judgments at their hypocrisy, infidelity, compromise, divorce, false worship, and arrogance.</p><p>Malachi set forth his prophecy in the form of a dispute, employing the question-andanswer method. The Lord&rsquo;s accusations against His people were frequently met by cynical questions from the people (1:2,6,7; 2:17; 3:7,8,13). At other times, the prophet presented himself as God&rsquo;s advocate in a lawsuit, posing rhetorical questions to the people based on their defiant criticisms (1:6,8,9; 2:10,15; 3:2).</p><p>Malachi indicted the priests and the people on at least 6 counts of willful sin: 1) repudiating God&rsquo;s love (1:2&ndash;5); 2) refusing God His due honor (1:6&ndash;2:9); 3) rejecting God&rsquo;s faithfulness (2:10&ndash;16); 4) redefining God&rsquo;s righteousness (2:17&ndash;3:5); 5) robbing God&rsquo;s riches (3:6&ndash;12); and 6) reviling God&rsquo;s grace (3:13&ndash;15). There are 3 interludes in which Malachi rendered God&rsquo;s judgment: 1) to the priests (2:1&ndash;9); 2) to the nation (3:1&ndash;6); and 3) to the remnant (3:16&ndash;4:6).</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>The meaning of Elijah being sent &ldquo;before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD&rdquo; (4:5) has been debated. Was this fulfilled in John the Baptist or is it yet future? Will Elijah be reincarnated? It seems best to view Malachi&rsquo;s prophecy as a reference to John the Baptist and not to a literally-returned Elijah. Not only did the angel announce that John the Baptist would &ldquo;go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah&rdquo; (Luke 1:17), but John the Baptist himself said he was not Elijah (John 1:21). Thus John was like Elijah, internally in &ldquo;spirit and power&rdquo; and externally in rugged independence and nonconformity. If the Jews would receive the Messiah, then he would be the Elijah spoken of (cf. Matt. 11:14; 17:9&ndash;13); if they refused the King, then another Elijah-like prophet would be sent in the future, perhaps as one of the two witnesses (cf. Rev. 11:1&ndash;19).</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I. The Denunciation of Israel&rsquo;s Sins (1:1&ndash;2:16)</strong></p><blockquote><p>A.

"40","40","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>Matthew, meaning &ldquo;gift of the Lord,&rdquo; was the other name of Levi (9:9), the tax collector who left everything to follow Christ (Luke 5:27, 28). Matthew was one of the 12 apostles (10:3; Mark 3:18; Luke 6:15; Acts 1:13). In his own list of the 12, he explicitly calls himself a &ldquo;tax collector&rdquo; (10:3). Nowhere else in Scripture is the name Matthew associated with &ldquo;tax collector&rdquo;; the other evangelists always employ his former name, Levi, when speaking of his sinful past. This is evidence of humility on Matthew&rsquo;s part. As with the other 3 gospels, this work is known by the name of its author.</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>The canonicity and Matthean authorship of this gospel were unchallenged in the early church. Eusebius (ca. A.D. 265&ndash;339) quotes Origen (ca. A.D . 185&ndash;254):</p><blockquote><p>Among the four Gospels, which are the only indisputable ones in the Church of God under heaven, I have learned by tradition that the first was written by Matthew, who was once a publican, but afterwards an apostle of Jesus Christ, and it was prepared for the converts from Judaism (<em>Ecclesiastical History</em>, 6:25).</p></blockquote><p>It is clear that this gospel was written at a relatively early date&mdash;prior to the destruction of the temple in A.D. 70. Some scholars have proposed a date as early as A.D. 50. For a further discussion of some of the issues related to the authorship and dating of this gospel, especially &ldquo;The Synoptic Problem,&rdquo; (<a href=""http://www.gty.org/resources/bible-introductions/MSB41"">see Introduction to Mark: Interpretive Challenges</a>).</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>The Jewish flavor of Matthew&rsquo;s gospel is remarkable. This is evident even in the opening genealogy, which Matthew traces back only as far as Abraham. In contrast, Luke, aiming to show Christ as the Redeemer of humanity, goes all the way back to Adam. Matthew&rsquo;s purpose is somewhat narrower: to demonstrate that Christ is the King and Messiah of Israel. This gospel quotes more than 60 times from OT prophetic passages, emphasizing how Christ is the fulfillment of all those promises.</p><p>The probability that Matthew&rsquo;s audience was predominantly Jewish is further evident from several facts: Matthew usually cites Jewish custom without explaining it, in contrast to the other gospels (cf. Mark 7:3; John 19:40). He constantly refers to Christ as &ldquo;the Son of David&rdquo; (1:1; 9:27; 12:23; 15:22; 20:30; 21:9, 15; 22:42, 45). Matthew even guards Jewish sensibilities regarding the name of God, referring to &ldquo;the kingdom of heaven&rdquo; where the other evangelists speak of &ldquo;the kingdom of God.&rdquo; All the book&rsquo;s major themes are rooted in the OT and set in light of Israel&rsquo;s messianic expectations.</p><p>Matthew&rsquo;s use of Greek may suggest that he was writing as a Palestinian Jew to Hellenistic Jews elsewhere. He wrote as an eyewitness of many of the events he described, giving firsthand testimony about the words and works of Jesus of Nazareth.</p><p>His purpose is clear: to demonstrate that Jesus is the Jewish nation&rsquo;s long-awaited Messiah. His voluminous quoting of the OT is specifically designed to show the tie between the Messiah of promise and the Christ of history. This purpose is never out of focus for Matthew, and he even adduces many incidental details from the OT prophecies as proofs of Jesus&rsquo; messianic claims (e.g., 2:17, 18; 4:13&ndash;15; 13:35; 21:4, 5; 27:9, 10).</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>Since Matthew is concerned with setting forth Jesus as Messiah, the King of the Jews, an interest in the OT kingdom promises runs throughout this gospel. Matthew&rsquo;s signature phrase &ldquo;the kingdom of heaven&rdquo; occurs 32 times in this book (and nowhere else in all of Scripture).</p><p>The opening genealogy is designed to document Christ&rsquo;s credentials as Israel&rsquo;s king, and the rest of the book completes this theme. Matthew shows that Christ is the heir of the kingly line. He demonstrates that He is the fulfillment of dozens of OT prophecies regarding the king who would come. He offers evidence after evidence to establish Christ&rsquo;s kingly prerogative. All other historical and theological themes in the book revolve around this one.</p><p>Matthew records 5 major discourses: the Sermon on the Mount (chaps. 5&ndash;7); the commissioning of the apostles (chap. 10); the parables about the kingdom (chap. 13); a discourse about the childlikeness of the believer (chap. 18); and the discourse on His second coming (chaps. 24, 25). Each discourse ends with a variation of this phrase: &ldquo;when Jesus had ended these sayings&rdquo; (7:28; 11:1; 13:53; 19:1; 26:1). That becomes a motif signaling a new narrative portion. A long opening section (chaps. 1&ndash;4) and a short conclusion (28:16&ndash;20), bracket the rest of the gospel, which naturally divides into 5 sections, each with a discourse and a narrative section. Some have seen a parallel between these 5 sections and the 5 books of Moses in the OT.</p><p>The conflict between Christ and Pharisaism is another common theme in Matthew&rsquo;s gospel. But Matthew is keen to show the error of the Pharisees for the benefit of his Jewish audience&mdash;not for personal or self-aggrandizing reasons. Matthew omits, for example, the parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector, even though that parable would have put him in a favorable light.</p><p>Matthew also mentions the Sadducees more than any of the other gospels. Both Pharisees and Sadducees are regularly portrayed negatively, and held up as warning beacons. Their doctrine is a leaven that must be avoided (16:11, 12). Although these groups were doctrinally at odds with one another, they were united in their hatred of Christ. To Matthew, they epitomized all in Israel who rejected Christ as King.</p><p>The rejection of Israel&rsquo;s Messiah is another constant theme in this gospel. In no other gospel are the attacks against Jesus portrayed as strongly as here. From the flight into Egypt to the scene at the cross, Matthew paints a more vivid portrayal of Christ&rsquo;s rejection than any of the other evangelists. In Matthew&rsquo;s account of the crucifixion, for example, no thief repents, and no friends or loved ones are seen at the foot of the cross. In His death, He is forsaken even by God (27:46). The shadow of rejection is never lifted from the story. Yet Matthew portrays Him as a victorious King who will one day return &ldquo;on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory&rdquo; (24:30).</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>As noted above, Matthew groups his narrative material around 5 great discourses. He makes no attempt to follow a strict chronology, and a comparison of the gospels reveals that Matthew freely places things out of order. He is dealing with themes and broad concepts, not laying out a timeline.</p><p>The prophetic passages present a particular interpretive challenge. Jesus&rsquo; Olivet discourse, for example, contains some details that evoke images of the violent destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70 Jesus&rsquo; words in 24:34 have led some to conclude that all these things were fulfilled&mdash;albeit not literally&mdash;in the Roman conquest of that era. This is the view known as &ldquo;preterism.&rdquo; But this is a serious interpretive blunder, forcing the interpreter to read into these passages spiritualized, allegorical meanings unwarranted by normal exegetical methods. The grammatical-historical hermeneutical approach to these passages is the approach to follow, and it yields a consistently futuristic interpretation of crucial prophecies.</p><p>For a discussion of the Synoptic Problem, <a href=""http://www.gty.org/resources/resources/bible-introductions/MSB41"">see Introduction to Mark: Interpretive Challenges</a>.</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><br /><p><strong>I.

"41","41","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p><p>Mark, for whom this gospel is named, was a close companion of the Apostle Peter and a recurring character in the book of Acts, where he is known as &ldquo;John whose surname was Mark&rdquo; (Acts 12:12, 25; 15:37, 39). It was to John Mark&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s home in Jerusalem that Peter went when released from prison (Acts 12:12).</p><p>John Mark was a cousin of Barnabas (Col. 4:10), who accompanied Paul and Barnabas on Paul&rsquo;s first missionary journey (Acts 12:25; 13:5). But he deserted them along the way in Perga and returned to Jerusalem (Acts 13:13). When Barnabas wanted Paul to take John Mark on the second missionary journey, Paul refused. The friction which resulted between Paul and Barnabas led to their separation (Acts 15:38&ndash;40).</p><p>But John Mark&rsquo;s earlier vacillation evidently gave way to great strength and maturity, and in time he proved himself even to the Apostle Paul. When Paul wrote the Colossians, he instructed them that if John Mark came, they were to welcome him (Col. 4:10). Paul even listed Mark as a fellow worker (Philem. 24). Later, Paul told Timothy to &ldquo;Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for ministry&rdquo; (2 Tim. 4:11).</p><p>John Mark&rsquo;s restoration to useful ministry may have been, in part, due to the ministry of Peter. Peter&rsquo;s close relationship with Mark is evident from his description of him as &ldquo;Mark my son&rdquo; (1 Pet. 5:13). Peter, of course, was no stranger to failure himself, and his influence on the younger man was no doubt instrumental in helping him out of the instability of his youth and into the strength and maturity he would need for the work to which God had called him.</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>Unlike the epistles, the gospels do not name their authors. The early church fathers, however, unanimously affirm that Mark wrote this second gospel. Papias, bishop of Hieropolis, writing about A.D. 140, noted:</p><blockquote><p>And the presbyter [the Apostle John] said this: Mark having become the interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered. It was not, however, in exact order that he related the sayings or deeds of Christ. For he neither heard the Lord nor accompanied Him. But afterwards, as I said, he accompanied Peter, who accommodated his instructions to the necessities [of his hearers], but with no intention of giving a regular narrative of the Lord&rsquo;s sayings. Wherefore Mark made no mistake in thus writing some things as he remembered them. For of one thing he took especial care, not to omit anything he had heard, and not to put anything fictitious into the statements. [<em>From the Exposition of the Oracles of the Lord</em> (6)]</p></blockquote><p>Justin Martyr, writing about A.D. 150, referred to the Gospel of Mark as &ldquo;the memoirs of Peter,&rdquo; and suggested that Mark committed his gospel to writing while in Italy. This agrees with the uniform voice of early tradition, which regarded this gospel as having been written in Rome, for the benefit of Roman Christians. Irenaeus, writing about A.D. 185, called Mark &ldquo;the disciple and interpreter of Peter,&rdquo; and recorded that the second gospel consisted of what Peter preached about Christ. The testimony of the church fathers differs as to whether this gospel was written before or after Peter&rsquo;s death (ca. A.D. 67&ndash;68).</p><p>Evangelical scholars have suggested dates for the writing of Mark&rsquo;s gospel ranging from A.D. 50 to 70. A date before the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple in A.D. 70 is required by the comment of Jesus in 13:2. Luke&rsquo;s gospel was clearly written before Acts (Acts 1:1&ndash;3). The date of the writing of Acts can probably be fixed at about A.D. 63, because that is shortly after the narrative ends (<a href=""http://www.gty.org/resources/Resources/Bible+Introductions/MSB44"">see Introduction to Acts: Author and Date</a>). It is therefore likely, though not certain, that Mark was written at an early date, probably sometime in the 50s.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>Whereas Matthew was written to a Jewish audience, Mark seems to have targeted Roman believers, particularly Gentiles. When employing Aramaic terms, Mark translated them for his readers (3:17; 5:41; 7:11, 34; 10:46; 14:36; 15:22, 34). On the other hand, in some places he used Latin expressions instead of their Greek equivalents (5:9; 6:27; 12:15, 42; 15:16, 39). He also reckoned time according to the Roman system (6:48; 13:35) and carefully explained Jewish customs (7:3, 4; 14:12; 15:42). Mark omitted Jewish elements, such as the genealogies found in Matthew and Luke. This gospel also makes fewer references to the OT, and includes less material that would be of particular interest to Jewish readers&mdash;such as that which is critical of the Pharisees and Sadducees (Sadducees are mentioned only once, in 12:18). When mentioning Simon the Cyrene (15:21), Mark identifies him as the father of Rufus, a prominent member of the church at Rome (Rom. 16:13). All of this supports the traditional view that Mark was written for a Gentile audience initially at Rome.</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>Mark presents Jesus as the suffering Servant of the Lord (10:45). His focus is on the deeds of Jesus more than His teaching, particularly emphasizing service and sacrifice. Mark omits the lengthy discourses found in the other gospels, often relating only brief excerpts to give the gist of Jesus&rsquo; teaching. Mark also omits any account of Jesus&rsquo; ancestry and birth, beginning where Jesus&rsquo; public ministry began, with His baptism by John in the wilderness.</p><p>Mark demonstrated the humanity of Christ more clearly than any of the other evangelists, emphasizing Christ&rsquo;s human emotions (1:41; 3:5; 6:34; 8:12; 9:36;), His human limitations (4:38; 11:12; 13:32), and other small details that highlight the human side of the Son of God (e.g., 7:33, 34; 8:12; 9:36; 10:13&ndash;16).</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>Three significant questions confront the interpreter of Mark: 1) What is the relationship of Mark to Luke and Matthew? (<em>see below, &ldquo;The Synoptic Problem&rdquo;</em>); 2) How should one interpret the eschatological passages? and 3) Were the last 12 verses of chap. 16 originally part of Mark&rsquo;s gospel?</p><p><strong><em>The Synoptic Problem</em></strong></p><p>Even a cursory reading of Matthew, Mark, and Luke reveals both striking similarities (cf. 2:3&ndash;12; Matt. 9:2&ndash;8; Luke 5:18&ndash;26) and significant differences, as each views the life, ministry, and teaching of Jesus. The question of how to explain those similarities and differences is known as the &ldquo;Synoptic Problem&rdquo; (<em>syn</em> means &ldquo;together&rdquo;; <em>optic</em> means &ldquo;seeing&rdquo;).</p><p>The modern solution&mdash;even among evangelicals&mdash;has been to assume that some form of literary dependence exists between the synoptic gospels. The most commonly accepted theory to explain such an alleged literary dependence is known as the &ldquo;Two-Source&rdquo; theory. According to that hypothesis, Mark was the first gospel written, and Matthew and Luke then used Mark as a source in writing their gospels. Proponents of this view imagine a nonexistent, second source, labeled <em>Q</em> (from the German word <em>Quelle</em>, &ldquo;source&rdquo;), and argue that this allegedly is the source of the material in Matthew and Luke that does not appear in Mark. They advance several lines of evidence to support their scenario.</p><p>First, most of Mark is paralleled in Matthew and Luke. Since it is much shorter than Matthew and Luke, the latter must be expansions of Mark. Second, the 3 gospels follow the same general chronological outline, but when either Matthew or Luke departs from Mark&rsquo;s chronology, the other agrees with Mark. Put another way, Matthew and Luke do not both depart from Mark&rsquo;s chronology in the same places. That, it is argued, shows that Matthew and Luke used Mark for their historical framework. Third, in passages common to all 3 gospels, Matthew&rsquo;s and Luke&rsquo;s wording seldom agrees when it differs from Mark&rsquo;s. Proponents of the &ldquo;Two-Source&rdquo; theory see that as confirmation that Matthew and Luke used Mark&rsquo;s gospel as a source.</p><p>But those arguments do not prove that Matthew and Luke used Mark&rsquo;s gospel as a source. In fact, the weight of evidence is strongly against such a theory:</p><p>1) The nearly unanimous testimony of the church until the nineteenth century was that Matthew was the first gospel written. Such an impressive body of evidence cannot be ignored.</p><p>2) Why would Matthew, an apostle and eyewitness to the events of Christ&rsquo;s life, depend on Mark (who was not an eyewitness)&mdash;even for the account of his own conversion?</p><p>3) A significant statistical analysis of the synoptic gospels has revealed that the parallels between them are far less extensive and the differences more significant than is commonly acknowledged. The differences, in particular, argue against literary dependence between the gospel writers.</p><p>4) Since the gospels record actual historical events, it would be surprising if they did not follow the same general historical sequence. For example, the fact that 3 books on American history all had the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War, and the Gulf War in the same chronological order would not prove that the authors had read each others&rsquo; books. General agreement in content does not prove literary dependency.</p><p>5) The passages in which Matthew and Luke agree against Mark (see argument 3 in favor of the &ldquo;Two-Source&rdquo; theory) amount to about one-sixth of Matthew and one-sixth of Luke. If they used Mark&rsquo;s gospel as a source, there is no satisfactory explanation for why Matthew and Luke would so often both change Mark&rsquo;s wording in the same way.</p><p>6) The &ldquo;Two-Source&rdquo; theory cannot account for the important section in Mark&rsquo;s gospel (6:45&ndash;8:26) which Luke omits. That omission suggests Luke had not seen Mark&rsquo;s gospel when he wrote.</p><p>7) There is no historical or manuscript evidence that the <em>Q</em> document ever existed; it is purely a fabrication of modern skepticism and a way to possibly deny the verbal inspiration of the gospels.</p><p>8) Any theory of literary dependence between the gospel writers overlooks the significance of their personal contacts with each other. Mark and Luke were both companions of Paul (cf. Philem. 24); the early church (including Matthew) met for a time in the home of Mark&rsquo;s mother (Acts 12:12); and Luke could easily have met Matthew during Paul&rsquo;s two-year imprisonment at Caesarea. Such contacts make theories of mutual literary dependence unnecessary.</p><p>The simplest solution to the Synoptic Problem is that no such problem exists! Because critics cannot prove literary dependence between the gospel writers, there is no need to explain it. The traditional view that the gospel writers were inspired by God and wrote independently of each other&mdash;except that all 3 were moved by the same Holy Spirit (2 Pet. 1:20)&mdash;remains the only plausible view.</p><p>As the reader compares the various viewpoints in the gospels, it becomes clear how well they harmonize and lead to a more complete picture of the whole event or message. The accounts are not contradictory, but complementary, revealing a fuller understanding when brought together. Apparent difficulties are dealt with in the notes of each gospel.</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I. Prologue: In the Wilderness (1:1&ndash;13)</strong></p></p><blockquote><p>A.

"42","42","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p><p>As with the other 3 gospels, the title is derived from the author&rsquo;s name. According to tradition, Luke was a Gentile. The Apostle Paul seems to confirm this, distinguishing Luke from those who were &ldquo;of the circumcision&rdquo; (Col. 4:11, 14). That would make Luke the only Gentile to pen any books of Scripture. He is responsible for a significant portion of the NT, having written both this gospel and the book of Acts (see Author and Date).</p><p>Very little is known about Luke. He almost never included personal details about himself, and nothing definite is known about his background or his conversion. Both Eusebius and Jerome identified him as a native of Antioch (which may explain why so much of the book of Acts centers on Antioch&mdash;cf. Acts 11:19&ndash;27; 13:1&ndash;3; 14:26; 15:22, 23, 30&ndash;35; 18:22, 23). Luke was a frequent companion of the Apostle Paul, at least from the time of Paul&rsquo;s Macedonian vision (Acts 16:9, 10) right up to the time of Paul&rsquo;s martyrdom (2 Tim. 4:11).</p><p>The Apostle Paul referred to Luke as a physician (Col. 4:14). Luke&rsquo;s interest in medical phenomena is evident in the high profile he gave to Jesus&rsquo; healing ministry (e.g., 4:38&ndash;40; 5:15&ndash;25; 6:17&ndash;19; 7:11&ndash;15; 8:43&ndash;47, 49&ndash;56; 9:2, 6, 11; 13:11&ndash;13; 14:2&ndash;4; 17:12&ndash;14; 22:50, 51). In Luke&rsquo;s day, physicians did not have a unique vocabulary of technical terminology; so when Luke discusses healings and other medical issues, his language is not markedly different from that of the other gospel writers.</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>The Gospel of Luke and the book of Acts clearly were written by the same individual (cf. 1:1&ndash;4; Acts 1:1). Although he never identified himself by name, it is clear from his use of &ldquo;we&rdquo; in many sections of Acts that he was a close companion of the Apostle Paul (Acts 16:10&ndash;17; 20:5&ndash;15; 21:1&ndash;18; 27:1&ndash;28:16). Luke is the only person, among the colleagues Paul mentions in his own epistles (Col. 4:14; 2 Tim. 4:11; Philem. 24), who fits the profile of the author of these books. That accords perfectly with the earliest tradition of the church which unanimously attributed this gospel to Luke.</p><p>Luke and Acts appear to have been written at about the same time&mdash;Luke first, then Acts. Combined, they make a 2-volume work addressed to &ldquo;Theophilus&rdquo; (1:3; Acts 1:1; see Background and Setting) giving a sweeping history of the founding of Christianity, from the birth of Christ to Paul&rsquo;s imprisonment under house arrest in Rome (Acts 28:30, 31).</p><p>The book of Acts ends with Paul still in Rome, which leads to the conclusion that Luke wrote these books from Rome during Paul&rsquo;s imprisonment there (ca. A.D. 60&ndash;62). Luke records Jesus&rsquo; prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70 (19:42&ndash;44; 21:20&ndash;24) but makes no mention of the fulfillment of that prophecy, either here or in Acts. Luke made it a point to record such prophetic fulfillments (cf. Acts 11:28), so it is extremely unlikely he wrote these books after the Roman invasion of Jerusalem. Acts also includes no mention of the great persecution that began under Nero in A.D. 64. In addition, many scholars set the date of James&rsquo; martyrdom at A.D. 62, and if that was before Luke completed his history, he certainly would have mentioned it. So, the most likely date for this gospel is A.D. 60 or 61.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>Luke dedicated his works to &ldquo;most excellent Theophilus&rdquo; (lit. &ldquo;lover of God&rdquo;&mdash;1:3; cf. Acts 1:1). This designation, which may be a nickname or a pseudonym, is accompanied by a formal address (&ldquo;most excellent&rdquo;)&mdash;possibly signifying that &ldquo;Theophilus&rdquo; was a well known Roman dignitary, perhaps one of those who had turned to Christ in &ldquo;Caesar&rsquo;s household&rdquo; (Phil. 4:22).</p><p>It is almost certain, however, that Luke envisioned a much broader audience for his work than this one man. The dedications at the outset of Luke and Acts are like the formal dedication in a modern book. They are not like the address of an epistle.</p><p>Luke expressly stated that his knowledge of the events recorded in his gospel came from the reports of those who were eyewitnesses (1:1, 2)&mdash;strongly implying that he himself was not an eyewitness. It is clear from his prologue that his aim was to give an ordered account of the events of Jesus&rsquo; life, but this does not mean he always followed a strict chronological order in all instances.</p><p>By acknowledging that he had compiled his account from various extant sources,Luke was not disclaiming divine inspiration for his work. The process of inspiration never bypasses or overrides the personalities, vocabularies, and styles of the human authors of Scripture. The unique traits of the human authors are always indelibly stamped on all the books of Scripture. Luke&rsquo;s research is no exception to this rule. The research itself was orchestrated by divine Providence. And in his writing, Luke was moved by the Spirit of God (2 Pet. 1:21). Therefore, his account is infallibly true.</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>Luke&rsquo;s style is that of a scholarly, well-read author. He wrote as a meticulous historian, often giving details that helped identify the historical context of the events he described (1:5; 2:1, 2; 3:1, 2; 13:1&ndash;4).</p><p>His account of the nativity is the fullest in all the gospel records&mdash;and (like the rest of Luke&rsquo;s work) more polished in its literary style. He included in the birth narrative a series of praise psalms (1:46&ndash;55; 1:68&ndash;79; 2:14; 2:29&ndash;32; 34, 35). He alone reported the unusual circumstances surrounding the birth of John the Baptist, the annunciation to Mary, the manger, the shepherds, and Simeon and Anna (2:25&ndash;38).</p><p>A running theme in Luke&rsquo;s gospel is Jesus&rsquo; compassion for Gentiles, Samaritans, women, children, tax collectors, sinners, and others often regarded as outcasts in Israel. Every time he mentions a tax collector (3:12; 5:27; 7:29; 15:1; 18:10&ndash;13; 19:2), it is in a positive sense. Yet, Luke did not ignore the salvation of those who were rich and respectable&mdash;e.g., 23:50&ndash;53. From the outset of Jesus&rsquo; public ministry (4:18) to the Lord&rsquo;s final words on the cross (23:40&ndash;43), Luke underscored this theme of Christ&rsquo;s ministry to the pariahs of society. Again and again he showed how the Great Physician ministered to those most aware of their need (cf. 5:31, 32; 15:4&ndash;7; 31, 32; 19:10).</p><p>The high profile Luke accords to women is particularly significant. From the nativity account, where Mary, Elizabeth, and Anna are given prominence (chaps. 1; 2), to the events of resurrection morning, where women again are major characters (24:1, 10), Luke emphasized the central role of women in the life and ministry of our Lord (e.g., 7:12&ndash;15, 37&ndash;50; 8:2, 3, 43&ndash;48; 10:38&ndash;42; 13:11&ndash;13; 21:2&ndash;4; 23:27&ndash;29, 49, 55, 56).</p><p>Several other recurring themes form threads through Luke&rsquo;s gospel. Examples of these are human fear in the presence of God; forgiveness (3:3; 5:20&ndash;25; 6:37; 7:41&ndash;50; 11:4; 12:10; 17:3, 4; 23:34; 24:47); joy (1:14); wonder at the mysteries of divine truth; the role of the Holy Spirit (1:15, 35, 41, 67; 2:25&ndash;27; 3:16, 22; 4:1, 14, 18; 10:21; 11:13; 12:10, 12); the temple in Jerusalem (1:9&ndash;22; 2:27&ndash;38, 46&ndash;49; 4:9&ndash;13; 18:10&ndash;14; 19:45&ndash;48; 20:1&ndash;21:6; 21:37, 38; 24:53); and Jesus&rsquo; prayers (6:12).</p><p>Starting with 9:51, Luke devoted 10 chapters of his narrative to a travelogue of Jesus&rsquo; final journey to Jerusalem. Much of the material in this section is unique to Luke. This is the heart of Luke&rsquo;s gospel, and it features a theme Luke stressed throughout: Jesus&rsquo; relentless progression toward the cross. This was the very purpose for which Christ had come to earth (cf. 9:22, 23; 17:25; 18:31&ndash;33; 24:25, 26, 46), and He would not be deterred. The saving of sinners was His whole mission (19:10).</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>Luke, like Mark, and in contrast to Matthew, appears to target a Gentile readership (for a discussion of the Synoptic Problem, <a href=""http://www.gty.org/resources/Resources/Bible+Introductions/MSB41"">see Introduction to Mark: Interpretive Challenges</a>). He identified locations that would have been familiar to all Jews (e.g., 4:31; 23:51; 24:13), suggesting that his audience went beyond those who already had knowledge of Palestinian geography. He usually preferred Greek terminology over Hebraisms (e.g., &ldquo;Calvary&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Golgotha&rdquo; in 23:33). The other gospels all use occasional Semitic terms such as &ldquo;Abba&rdquo; (Mark 14:36), &ldquo;rabbi&rdquo; (Matt. 23:7, 8; John 1:38, 49), and &ldquo;hosanna&rdquo; (Matt. 21:9; Mark 11:9, 10; John 12:13)&mdash;but Luke either omitted them or used Greek equivalents.</p><p>Luke quoted the OT more sparingly than Matthew, and when citing OT passages, he nearly always employed the LXX, a Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures. Furthermore, most of Luke&rsquo;s OT citations are allusions rather than direct quotations, and many of them appear in Jesus&rsquo; words rather than Luke&rsquo;s narration (2:23, 24; 3:4&ndash;6; 4:4, 8, 10&ndash;12, 18, 19; 7:27; 10:27; 18:20; 19:46; 20:17, 18, 37, 42, 43; 22:37).</p><p>Luke, more than any of the other gospel writers, highlighted the universal scope of the gospel invitation. He portrayed Jesus as the Son of Man, rejected by Israel, and then offered to the world. As noted above (see Historical and Theological Themes), Luke repeatedly related accounts of Gentiles, Samaritans, and other outcasts who found grace in Jesus&rsquo; eyes. This emphasis is precisely what we would expect from a close companion of the &ldquo;apostle of the Gentiles&rdquo; (Rom. 11:13).</p><p>Yet some critics have claimed to see a wide gap between Luke&rsquo;s theology and that of Paul. It is true that Luke&rsquo;s gospel is practically devoid of terminology that is uniquely Pauline. Luke wrote with his own style. Yet the underlying theology is perfectly in harmony with that of the apostle&rsquo;s. The centerpiece of Paul&rsquo;s doctrine was justification by faith (Rom. 3:24). Luke also highlighted and illustrated justification by faith in many of the incidents and parables he related, chiefly the account of the Pharisee and the publican (18:9&ndash;14); the familiar story of the Prodigal Son (15:11&ndash;32); the incident at Simon&rsquo;s house (7:36&ndash;50); and the salvation of Zacchaeus (19:1&ndash;10).</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I.

"43","43","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p><p>The title of the fourth gospel continues the pattern of the other gospels, being identified originally as &ldquo;According to John.&rdquo; Like the others, &ldquo;The Gospel&rdquo; was added later.</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>Although the author&rsquo;s name does not appear in the gospel, early church tradition strongly and consistently identified him as the Apostle John. The early church father Irenaeus (ca. A.D.130&ndash;200) was a disciple of Polycarp (ca. A.D. 70&ndash;160), who was a disciple of the Apostle John, and he testified on Polycarp&rsquo;s authority that John wrote the gospel during his residence at Ephesus in Asia Minor when he was advanced in age (<em>Against Heresies</em> 2.22.5; 3.1.1). Subsequent to Irenaeus, all the church fathers assumed John to be the gospel&rsquo;s author. Clement of Alexandria (ca. A.D. 150&ndash;215) wrote that John, aware of the facts set forth in the other gospels and being moved by the Holy Spirit, composed a &ldquo;spiritual gospel&rdquo; (see Eusebius&rsquo; <em>Ecclesiastical History</em> 6.14.7).</p><p>Reinforcing early church tradition are significant internal characteristics of the gospel. While the synoptic gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke) identify the Apostle John by name approximately 20 times (including parallels), he is not directly mentioned by name in the Gospel of John. Instead, the author prefers to identify himself as the disciple &ldquo;whom Jesus loved&rdquo; (13:23; 19:26; 20:2; 21:7, 20). The absence of any mention of John&rsquo;s name directly is remarkable when one considers the important part played by other named disciples in this gospel. Yet, the recurring designation of himself as the disciple &ldquo;whom Jesus loved,&rdquo; a deliberate avoidance by John of his personal name, reflects his humility and celebrates his relation to his Lord Jesus. No mention of his name was necessary since his original readers clearly understood that he was the gospel&rsquo;s author. Also, through a process of elimination based primarily on analyzing the material in chaps. 20, 21, this disciple &ldquo;whom Jesus loved&rdquo; narrows down to the Apostle John (e.g., 21:24; cf. 21:2). Since the gospel&rsquo;s author is exacting in mentioning the names of other characters in the book, if the author had been someone other than John the apostle, he would not have omitted John&rsquo;s name.</p><p>The gospel&rsquo;s anonymity strongly reinforces the arguments favoring John&rsquo;s authorship, for only someone of his well known and preeminent authority as an apostle would be able to write a gospel that differed so markedly in form and substance from the other gospels and have it receive unanimous acceptance in the early church. In contrast, apocryphal gospels produced from the mid-second century onward were falsely ascribed to apostles or other famous persons closely associated with Jesus, yet universally rejected by the church.</p><p>John and James, his older brother (Acts 12:2), were known as &ldquo;the sons of Zebedee&rdquo; (Matt. 10:2&ndash;4), and Jesus gave them the name &ldquo;Sons of Thunder&rdquo; (Mark 3:17). John was an apostle (Luke 6:12&ndash;16) and one of the 3 most intimate associates of Jesus (along with Peter and James&mdash;cf. Matt. 17:1; 26:37), being an eyewitness to and participant in Jesus&rsquo; earthly ministry (1 John 1:1&ndash;4). After Christ&rsquo;s ascension, John became a &ldquo;pillar&rdquo; in the Jerusalem church (Gal. 2:9). He ministered with Peter (Acts 3:1; 4:13; 8:14) until he went to Ephesus (tradition says before the destruction of Jerusalem), from where he wrote this gospel and from where the Romans exiled him to Patmos (Rev. 1:9). Besides the gospel that bears his name, John also authored 1&ndash;3 John and the Book of Revelation (Rev. 1:1).</p><p>Because the writings of some church fathers indicate that John was actively writing in his old age and that he was already aware of the synoptic gospels, many date the gospel sometime after their composition, but prior to John&rsquo;s writing of 1&ndash;3 John or Revelation. John wrote his gospel ca. A.D. 80&ndash;90, about 50 years after he witnessed Jesus&rsquo; earthly ministry.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>Strategic to John&rsquo;s background and setting is the fact that according to tradition John was aware of the synoptic gospels. Apparently, he wrote his gospel in order to make a unique contribution to the record of the Lord&rsquo;s life (&ldquo;a spiritual gospel&rdquo;) and, in part, to be supplementary as well as complementary to Matthew, Mark, and Luke.</p><p>The gospel&rsquo;s unique characteristics reinforce this purpose: First, John supplied a large amount of unique material not recorded in the other gospels. Second, he often supplied information that helps the understanding of the events in the synoptics. For example, while the synoptics begin with Jesus&rsquo; ministry in Galilee, they imply that Jesus had a ministry prior to that (e.g., Matt. 4:12; Mark 1:14). John supplies the answer with information on Jesus&rsquo; prior ministry in Judea (chap. 3) and Samaria (chap. 4). In Mark 6:45, after the feeding of the 5,000, Jesus compelled his disciples to cross the Sea of Galilee to Bethsaida. John recorded the reason. The people were about to make Jesus king because of His miraculous multiplying of food, and He was avoiding their ill-motivated efforts (6:26). Third, John is the most theological of the gospels, containing, for example, a heavily theological prologue (1:1&ndash;18), larger amounts of didactic and discourse material in proportion to narrative (e.g., 3:13&ndash;17), and the largest amount of teaching on the Holy Spirit (e.g., 14:16, 17, 26; 16:7&ndash;14). Although John was aware of the synoptics and fashioned his gospel with them in mind, he did not depend upon them for information. Rather, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, he utilized his own memory as an eyewitness in composing the gospel (1:14; 19:35; 21:24).</p><p>John&rsquo;s gospel is the only one of the 4 that contains a precise statement regarding the author&rsquo;s purpose (20:30, 31). He declares, &ldquo;these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name&rdquo; (20:31). The primary purposes, therefore, are two-fold: evangelistic and apologetic. Reinforcing the evangelistic purpose is the fact that the word &ldquo;believe&rdquo; occurs approximately 100 times in the gospel (the synoptics use the term less than half as much). John composed his gospel to provide reasons for saving faith in his readers and, as a result, to assure them that they would receive the divine gift of eternal life (1:12).</p><p>The apologetic purpose is closely related to the evangelistic purpose. John wrote to convince his readers of Jesus&rsquo; true identity as the incarnate God-Man whose divine and human natures were perfectly united into one person who was the prophesied Christ (&ldquo;Messiah&rdquo;) and Savior of the world (e.g., 1:41; 3:16; 4:25, 26; 8:58). He organized his whole gospel around 8 &ldquo;signs&rdquo; or proofs that reinforce Jesus&rsquo; true identity leading to faith. The first half of his work centers around 7 miraculous signs selected to reveal Christ&rsquo;s person and engender belief: 1) water made into wine (2:1&ndash;11); 2) the healing of the royal official&rsquo;s son (4:46&ndash;54); 3) the healing of the lame man (5:1&ndash;18); 4) the feeding of multitude (6:1&ndash;15); 5) walking on water (6:16&ndash;21); 6) healing of the blind man (9:1&ndash;41); and 7) the raising of Lazarus (11:1&ndash;57). The eighth sign is the miraculous catch of fish (21:6&ndash;11) after Jesus&rsquo; resurrection.</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>In accordance with John&rsquo;s evangelistic and apologetic purposes, the overall message of the gospel is found in 20:31: &ldquo;Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God.&rdquo; The book, therefore, centers on the person and work of Christ. Three predominant words (&ldquo;signs,&rdquo; &ldquo;believe,&rdquo; and &ldquo;life&rdquo;) in 20:30, 31 receive constant reemphasis throughout the gospel to enforce the theme of salvation in Him, which is first set forth in the prologue (1:1&ndash;18; cf. 1 John 1:1&ndash;4) and reexpressed throughout the gospel in varying ways (e.g., 6:35, 48; 8:12; 10:7, 9; 10:11&ndash;14; 11:25; 14:6; 17:3). In addition, John provides the record of how men responded to Jesus Christ and the salvation that He offered. Summing up, the gospel focuses on: 1) Jesus as the Word, the Messiah, and Son of God; 2) who brings the gift of salvation to mankind; 3) who either accept or reject the offer.</p><p>John also presents certain contrastive sub-themes that reinforce his main theme. He uses dualism (life and death, light and darkness, love and hate, from above and from below) to convey vital information about the person and work of Christ and the need to believe in Him (e.g., 1:4, 5, 12, 13; 3:16&ndash;21; 12:44&ndash;46; 15:17&ndash;20).</p><p>There are also 7 emphatic &ldquo;I AM&rdquo; statements which identify Jesus as God and Messiah (6:35; 8:12; 10:7, 9; 10:11, 14; 11:25; 14:6; 15:1, 5).</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>Because John composed his record in a clear and simple style, one might tend to underestimate the depth of this gospel. Since John&rsquo;s gospel is a &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; gospel (see Authorship and Date), the truths he conveys are profound. The reader must prayerfully and meticulously explore the book, in order to discover the vast richness of the spiritual treasures that the apostle, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit (14:26; 16:13), has lovingly deposited in his gospel.</p><p>The chronological reckoning between John&rsquo;s gospel and the synoptics presents a challenge, especially in relation to the time of the Last Supper (13:2). While the synoptics portray the disciples and the Lord at the Last Supper as eating the Passover meal on Thursday evening (Nisan 14) and Jesus being crucified on Friday, John&rsquo;s gospel states that the Jews did not enter into the Praetorium &ldquo;lest they should be defiled, but that they might eat the Passover&rdquo; (18:28). So, the disciples had eaten the Passover on Thursday evening, but the Jews had not. In fact, John (19:14) states that Jesus&rsquo; trial and crucifixion were on the day of Preparation for the Passover and not after the eating of the Passover, so that with the trial and crucifixion on Friday Christ was actually sacrificed at the same time the Passover lambs were being slain (19:14). The question is, &ldquo;Why did the disciples eat the Passover meal on Thursday?&rdquo;</p><p>The answer lies in a difference among the Jews in the way they reckoned the beginning and ending of days. From Josephus, the Mishna, and other ancient Jewish sources we learn that the Jews in northern Palestine calculated days from sunrise to sunrise. That area included the region of Galilee, where Jesus and all the disciples, except Judas, had grown up. Apparently most, if not all, of the Pharisees used that system of reckoning. But Jews in the southern part, which centered in Jerusalem, calculated days from sunset to sunset. Because all the priests necessarily lived in or near Jerusalem, as did most of the Sadducees, those groups followed the southern scheme.</p><p>That variation doubtlessly caused confusion at times, but it also had some practical benefits. During Passover time, for instance, it allowed for the feast to be celebrated legitimately on two adjoining days, thereby permitting the temple sacrifices to be made over a total period of four hours rather than two. That separation of days may also have had the effect of reducing both regional and religious clashes between the two groups.</p><p>On that basis the seeming contradictions in the gospel accounts are easily explained. Being Galileans, Jesus and the disciples considered Passover day to have started at sunrise on Thursday and to end at sunrise on Friday. The Jewish leaders who arrested and tried Jesus, being mostly priests and Sadducees, considered Passover day to begin at sunset on Thursday and end at sunset on Friday. By that variation, predetermined by God&rsquo;s sovereign provision, Jesus could thereby legitimately celebrate the last Passover meal with His disciples and yet still be sacrificed on Passover day.</p><p>Once again one can see how God sovereignly and marvelously provides for the precise fulfillment of His redemptive plan. Jesus was anything but a victim of men&rsquo;s wicked schemes, much less of blind circumstance. Every word He spoke and every action He took were divinely directed and secured. Even the words and actions by others against Him were divinely controlled. See, e.g., 11:49&ndash;52; 19:11.</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I.

"44","44","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p><p>As the second book Luke addressed to Theophilus (see Luke 1:3), Acts may originally have had no title. The Greek manuscripts title it &ldquo;Acts,&rdquo; and many add &ldquo;of the Apostles.&rdquo; The Greek word translated &ldquo;Acts&rdquo; (<em>praxeis</em>) was often used to describe the achievements of great men. Acts does feature the notable figures in the early years of the church, especially Peter (chaps. 1&ndash;12) and Paul (chaps. 13&ndash;28). But the book could more properly be called &ldquo;The Acts of the Holy Spirit through the Apostles,&rdquo; since His sovereign, superintending work was far more significant than that of any man. It was the Spirit&rsquo;s directing, controlling, and empowering ministry that strengthened the church and caused it to grow in numbers, spiritual power, and influence.</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>Since Luke&rsquo;s gospel was the first book addressed to Theophilus (Luke 1:3), it is logical to conclude that Luke is also the author of Acts, although he is not named in either book. The writings of the early church Fathers such as Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, Origen, Eusebius, and Jerome affirm Luke&rsquo;s authorship, and so does the Muratorian Canon (ca. A.D. 170). Because he is a relatively obscure figure, mentioned only 3 times in the NT (Col. 4:14; 2 Tim. 4:11, Philem. 24), it is unlikely that anyone would have forged a work to make it appear to be Luke&rsquo;s. A forger surely would have attributed his work to a more prominent person.</p><p>Luke was Paul&rsquo;s close friend, traveling companion, and personal physician (Col. 4:14). He was a careful researcher (Luke 1:1&ndash;4) and an accurate historian, displaying an intimate knowledge of Roman laws and customs, as well as the geography of Palestine, Asia Minor, and Italy. In writing Acts, Luke drew on written sources (15:23&ndash;29; 23:26&ndash;30), and also no doubt interviewed key figures, such as Peter, John, and others in the Jerusalem church. Paul&rsquo;s two-year imprisonment at Caesarea (24:27) gave Luke ample opportunity to interview Philip and his daughters (who were considered important sources of information on the early days of the church). Finally, Luke&rsquo;s frequent use of the first person plural pronouns &ldquo;we&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo;(16:10&ndash;17; 20:5&ndash;21:18; 27:1&ndash;28:16) reveals that he was an eyewitness to many of the events recorded in Acts.</p><p>Some believe Luke wrote Acts after the fall of Jerusalem (A.D. 70; his death was probably in the mid-eighties). It is more likely, however, that he wrote much earlier, before the end of Paul&rsquo;s first Roman imprisonment (ca. A.D. 60&ndash;62). That date is the most natural explanation for the abrupt ending of Acts&mdash;which leaves Paul awaiting trial before Caesar. Surely Luke, who devoted more than half of Acts to Paul&rsquo;s ministry, would have given the outcome of that trial, and described Paul&rsquo;s subsequent ministry, second imprisonment (cf. 2 Tim. 4:11), and death, if those events had happened before he wrote Acts. Luke&rsquo;s silence about such notable events as the martyrdom of James, head of the Jerusalem church (A.D. 62 according to the Jewish historian Josephus), the persecution under Nero (A.D. 64), and the fall of Jerusalem (A.D. 70) also suggests he wrote Acts before those events transpired.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>As Luke makes clear in the prologue to his gospel, he wrote to give Theophilus (and the others who would read his work) a &ldquo;narrative of those things&rdquo; (Luke 1:1) which Jesus had accomplished during His earthly ministry. Accordingly, Luke wrote in his gospel &ldquo;an orderly account&rdquo; (Luke 1:3) of those momentous events. Acts continues that record, noting what Jesus accomplished through the early church. Beginning with Jesus&rsquo; ascension, through the birth of the church on the Day of Pentecost, to Paul&rsquo;s preaching at Rome, Acts chronicles the spread of the gospel and the growth of the church (cf. 1:15; 2:41, 47; 4:4; 5:14; 6:7; 9:31; 12:24; 13:49; 16:5; 19:20). It also records the mounting opposition to the gospel (cf. 2:13; 4:1&ndash;22; 5:17&ndash;42; 6:9&ndash;8:4; 12:1&ndash;5; 13:6&ndash;12, 45&ndash;50; 14:2&ndash;6, 19, 20; 16:19&ndash;24; 17:5&ndash;9; 19:23&ndash;41; 21:27&ndash;36; 23:12&ndash;21; 28:24).</p><p>Theophilus, whose name means &ldquo;lover of God,&rdquo; is unknown to history apart from his mention in Luke and Acts. Whether he was a believer whom Luke was instructing, or a pagan whom Luke sought to convert is not known. Luke&rsquo;s address of him as &ldquo;most excellent Theophilus&rdquo; (Luke 1:3) suggests he was a Roman official of some importance (cf. 24:3; 26:25).</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>As the first work of church history ever penned, Acts records the initial response to the Great Commission (Matt. 28:19, 20). It provides information on the first 3 decades of the church&rsquo;s existence&mdash;material found nowhere else in the NT. Though not primarily a doctrinal work, Acts nonetheless emphasizes that Jesus of Nazareth was Israel&rsquo;s long-awaited Messiah, shows that the gospel is offered to all men (not merely the Jewish people), and stresses the work of the Holy Spirit (mentioned more than 50 times). Acts also makes frequent use of the OT: e.g., 2:17&ndash;21 (Joel 2:28&ndash;32); 2:25&ndash;28 (Ps. 16:8&ndash;11); 2:35 (Ps. 110:1); 4:11 (Ps. 118:22); 4:25, 26 (Ps. 2:1, 2); 7:49, 50 (Is. 66:1, 2); 8:32, 33 (Is. 53:7, 8); 28:26, 27 (Is. 6:9, 10).</p><p>Acts abounds with transitions: from the ministry of Jesus to that of the apostles; from the Old Covenant to the New Covenant; from Israel as God&rsquo;s witness nation to the church (composed of both Jews and Gentiles) as God&rsquo;s witness people. The book of Hebrews sets forth the theology of the transition from the Old Covenant to the New; Acts depicts the New Covenant&rsquo;s practical outworking in the life of the church.</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>Because Acts is primarily a historical narrative, not a theological treatise like Romans or Hebrews, it contains relatively few interpretive challenges. Those that exist mainly concern the book&rsquo;s transitional nature (see Historical and Theological Themes) and involve the role of signs and wonders. Those issues are addressed in the notes to the relevant passages (e.g., 2:1&ndash;47; 15:1&ndash;29).</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>Prologue (1:1&ndash;8)</strong></p><p><strong>I.

"45","45","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>This epistle&rsquo;s name comes from its original recipients: the members of the church in Rome, the capital of the Roman Empire (1:7).</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>No one disputes that the apostle Paul wrote Romans. Like his namesake, Israel&rsquo;s first king (Saul was Paul&rsquo;s Hebrew name; Paul his Greek name), Paul was from the tribe of Benjamin (Phil. 3:5). He was also a Roman citizen (Acts 16:37; 22:25). Paul was born about the time of Christ&rsquo;s birth, in Tarsus (Acts 9:11), an important city (Acts 21:39) in the Roman province of Cilicia, located in Asia Minor (modern Turkey). He spent much of his early life in Jerusalem as a student of the celebrated rabbi Gamaliel (Acts 22:3). Like his father before him, Paul was a Pharisee (Acts 23:6), a member of the strictest Jewish sect (cf. Phil. 3:5).</p><p>Miraculously converted while on his way to Damascus (ca. A.D. 33&ndash;34) to arrest Christians in that city, Paul immediately began proclaiming the gospel message (Acts 9:20). After narrowly escaping from Damascus with his life (Acts 9:23&ndash;25; 2 Cor. 11:32, 33), Paul spent 3 years in Nabatean Arabia, south and east of the Dead Sea (Gal. 1:17, 18). During that time, he received much of his doctrine as direct revelation from the Lord (Gal. 1:11, 12).</p><p>More than any other individual, Paul was responsible for the spread of Christianity throughout the Roman Empire. He made 3 missionary journeys through much of the Mediterranean world, tirelessly preaching the gospel he had once sought to destroy (Acts 26:9). After he returned to Jerusalem bearing an offering for the needy in the church there, he was falsely accused by some Jews (Acts 21:27&ndash;29), savagely beaten by an angry mob (Acts 21:30, 31), and arrested by the Romans. Though two Roman governors, Felix and Festus, as well as Herod Agrippa, did not find him guilty of any crime, pressure from the Jewish leaders kept Paul in Roman custody. After two years, the apostle exercised his right as a Roman citizen and appealed his case to Caesar. After a harrowing trip (Acts 27, 28), including a violent, two-week storm at sea that culminated in a shipwreck, Paul reached Rome. Eventually released for a brief period of ministry, he was arrested again and suffered martyrdom at Rome in ca. A.D. 65&ndash;67 (cf. 2 Tim. 4:6).</p><p>Though physically unimpressive (cf. 2 Cor. 10:10; Gal. 4:14), Paul possessed an inner strength granted him through the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s power (Phil. 4:13). The grace of God proved sufficient to provide for his every need (2 Cor. 12:9, 10), enabling this noble servant of Christ to successfully finish his spiritual race (2 Tim. 4:7).</p><p>Paul wrote Romans from Corinth, as the references to Phoebe (Rom. 16:1, Cenchrea was Corinth&rsquo;s port), Gaius (Rom. 16:23), and Erastus (Rom. 16:23)&mdash;all of whom were associated with Corinth&mdash;indicate. The apostle wrote the letter toward the close of his third missionary journey (most likely in A.D. 56), as he prepared to leave for Palestine with an offering for the poor believers in the Jerusalem church (Rom. 15:25). Phoebe was given the great responsibility of delivering this letter to the Roman believers (16:1, 2).</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>Rome was the capital and most important city of the Roman Empire. It was founded in 753 B.C., but is not mentioned in Scripture until NT times. Rome is located along the banks of the Tiber River, about 15 miles from the Mediterranean Sea. Until an artificial harbor was built at nearby Ostia, Rome&rsquo;s main harbor was Puteoli, some 150 miles away. In Paul&rsquo;s day, the city had a population of over one million people, many of whom were slaves. Rome boasted magnificent buildings, such as the Emperor&rsquo;s palace, the Circus Maximus, and the Forum, but its beauty was marred by the slums in which so many lived. According to tradition, Paul was martyred outside Rome on the Ostian Way during Nero&rsquo;s reign (A.D. 54&ndash;68).</p><p>Some of those converted on the Day of Pentecost probably founded the church at Rome (cf. Acts 2:10). Paul had long sought to visit the Roman church, but had been prevented from doing so (1:13). In God&rsquo;s providence, Paul&rsquo;s inability to visit Rome gave the world this inspired masterpiece of gospel doctrine.</p><p>Paul&rsquo;s primary purpose in writing Romans was to teach the great truths of the gospel of grace to believers who had never received apostolic instruction. The letter also introduced him to a church where he was personally unknown, but hoped to visit soon for several important reasons: to edify the believers (1:11); to preach the gospel (1:15); and to get to know the Roman Christians, so they could encourage him (1:12; 15:32), better pray for him (15:30), and help him with his planned ministry in Spain (15:28).</p><p>Unlike some of Paul&rsquo;s other epistles (e.g., 1, 2 Cor., Gal.), his purpose for writing was not to correct aberrant theology or rebuke ungodly living. The Roman church was doctrinally sound, but, like all churches, it was in need of the rich doctrinal and practical instruction this letter provides.</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>Since Romans is primarily a work of doctrine, it contains little historical material. Paul does use such familiar OT figures as Abraham (chap. 4), David (4:6&ndash;8), Adam (5:12&ndash;21), Sarah (9:9), Rebekah (9:10), Jacob and Esau (9:10&ndash;13), and Pharaoh (9:17) as illustrations. He also recounts some of Israel&rsquo;s history (chaps. 9&ndash;11). Chapter 16 provides insightful glimpses into the nature and character of the first-century church and its members.</p><p>The overarching theme of Romans is the righteousness that comes from God: the glorious truth that God justifies guilty, condemned sinners by grace alone through faith in Christ alone. Chapters 1&ndash;11 present the theological truths of that doctrine, while chaps. 12&ndash;16 detail<br />its practical outworking in the lives of individual believers and the life of the whole church. Some specific theological topics include principles of spiritual leadership (1:8&ndash;15); God&rsquo;s wrath against sinful mankind (1:18&ndash;32); principles of divine judgment (2:1&ndash;16); the universality of sin (3:9&ndash;20); an exposition and defense of justification by faith alone (3:21&ndash;4:25); the security of salvation (5:1&ndash;11); the transference of Adam&rsquo;s sin (5:12&ndash;21); sanctification (chaps. 6&ndash;8); sovereign election (chap. 9); God&rsquo;s plan for Israel (chap. 11); spiritual gifts and practical godliness (chap. 12); the believer&rsquo;s responsibility to human government (chap. 13); and principles of Christian liberty (14:1&ndash;15:12).</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>As the preeminent doctrinal work in the NT, Romans naturally contains a number of difficult passages. Paul&rsquo;s discussion of the perpetuation of Adam&rsquo;s sin (5:12&ndash;21) is one of the deepest, most profound theological passages in all of Scripture. The nature of mankind&rsquo;s union with Adam, and how his sin was transferred to the human race has always been the subject of intense debate. Bible students also disagree on whether 7:7&ndash;25 describes Paul&rsquo;s experience as a believer or unbeliever, or is a literary device not intended to be autobiographical at all. The closely related doctrines of election (8:28&ndash;30) and the sovereignty of God (9:6&ndash;29) have confused many believers. Others question whether chaps. 9&ndash;11 teach that God has a future plan for the nation of Israel. Some have ignored Paul&rsquo;s teaching on the believer&rsquo;s obedience to human government (13:1&ndash;7) in the name of Christian activism, while others have used it to defend slavish obedience to totalitarian regimes.</p><p>All of these and more interpretive challenges are addressed in the notes to the respective passages.</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I.

"46","46","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>The letter is named for the city of Corinth, where the church to whom it was written was located. With the exception of personal epistles addressed to Timothy, Titus, and Philemon, all Paul&rsquo;s letters bear the name of the city where the church addressed existed.</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>As indicated in the first verse, the epistle was written by the Apostle Paul, whose authorship cannot be seriously questioned. Pauline authorship has been universally accepted by the church since the first century, when 1 Corinthians was penned. Internally, the apostle claimed to have written the epistle (1:1, 13; 3:4&ndash;6; 4:15; 16:21). Externally, this correspondence has been acknowledged as genuine since A.D. 95 by Clement of Rome, who was writing to the Corinthian church. Other early Christian leaders who authenticated Paul as author include Ignatius (ca. A.D. 110), Polycarp (ca. A.D. 135), and Tertullian (ca. A.D. 200).</p><p>This epistle was most likely written in the first half of A.D. 55 from Ephesus (16:8, 9, 19) while Paul was on his third missionary journey. The apostle intended to remain on at Ephesus to complete his 3 year stay (Acts 20:31) until Pentecost (May/June) A.D. 55 (16:8). Then he hoped to winter (A.D. 55&ndash;56) at Corinth (16:6; Acts 20:2). His departure for Corinth was anticipated even as he wrote (4:19; 11:34; 16:8).</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>The city of Corinth was located in southern Greece, in what was the Roman province of Achaia, ca. 45 miles W from Athens. This lower part, the Peloponnesus, is connected to the rest of Greece by a 4-mile-wide isthmus, which is bounded on the E by the Saronic Gulf and on the W by the Gulf of Corinth. Corinth is near the middle of the isthmus and is prominently situated on a high plateau. For many centuries, all N-S land traffic in that area had to pass through or near this ancient city. Since travel by sea around the Peloponnesus involved a 250 mile voyage that was dangerous and obviously time consuming, most captains carried their ships on skids or rollers across the isthmus directly past Corinth. Corinth understandably prospered as a major trade city, not only for most of Greece but for much of the Mediterranean area, including North Africa, Italy, and Asia Minor. A canal across the isthmus was begun by the emperor Nero during the first century A.D., but was not completed until<br />near the end of the nineteenth century.</p><p>The Isthmian games, one of the two most famous athletic events of that day (the other being the Olympian games), was hosted by Corinth, causing more people-traffic. Even by the pagan standards of its own culture, Corinth became so morally corrupt that its very name became synonymous with debauchery and moral depravity. To &ldquo;corinthianize&rdquo; came to represent gross immorality and drunken debauchery. In 6:9, 10, Paul lists some of the specific sins for which the city was noted and which formerly had characterized many believers in the church there. Tragically, some of the worst sins were still found among some church members. One of those sins, incest, was condemned even by most pagan Gentiles (5:1).</p><p>Like most ancient Greek cities, Corinth had an acropolis (literally. &ldquo;a high city&rdquo;), which rose 2,000 feet and was used both for defense and for worship. The most prominent edifice on the acropolis was a temple to Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love. Some 1, 000 priestesses, who were &ldquo;religious&rdquo; prostitutes, lived and worked there and came down into the city in the evening to offer their services to male citizens and foreign visitors.</p><p>The church in Corinth was founded by Paul on his second missionary journey (Acts 18:1ff.). As usual, his ministry began in the synagogue, where he was assisted by two Jewish believers, Priscilla and Aquila, with whom he lived for a while and who were fellow tradesmen. Soon after, Silas and Timothy joined them and Paul began preaching even more intensely in the synagogue. When most of the Jews resisted the gospel, he left the synagogue, but not before Crispus, the leader of the synagogue, his family, and many other Corinthians were converted (Acts 18:5&ndash;8).</p><p>After ministering in Corinth for over a year and a half (Acts 18:11), Paul was brought before a Roman tribunal by some of the Jewish leaders. Because the charges were strictly religious and not civil, the proconsul, Gallio, dismissed the case. Shortly thereafter, Paul took Priscilla and Aquila with him to Ephesus. From there he returned to Israel (vv. 18&ndash;22).</p><p>Unable to fully break with the culture from which it came, the church at Corinth was exceptionally factional, showing its carnality and immaturity. After the gifted Apollos had ministered in the church for some time, a group of his admirers established a clique and had little to do with the rest of the church. Another group developed that was loyal to Paul, another claimed special allegiance to Peter (Cephas), and still another to Christ alone (see 1:10&ndash;13; 3:1&ndash;9).</p><p>The most serious problem of the Corinthian church was worldliness, an unwillingness to divorce the culture around them. Most of the believers could not consistently separate themselves from their old, selfish, immoral, and pagan ways. It became necessary for Paul to write to correct this, as well as to command the faithful Christians not only to break fellowship with the disobedient and unrepentant members, but to put those members out of the church (5:9&ndash;13).</p><p>Before he wrote this inspired letter, Paul had written the church other correspondence (see 5:9), which was also corrective in nature. Because a copy of that letter has never been discovered, it has been referred to as &ldquo;the lost epistle.&rdquo; There was another non-canonical letter after 1 Corinthians, usually called &ldquo;the severe letter&rdquo; (2 Cor. 2:4).</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>Although the major thrust of this epistle is corrective of behavior rather than of doctrine, Paul gives seminal teaching on many doctrines that directly relate to the matters of sin and righteousness. In one way or another, wrong living always stems from wrong belief. Sexual sins for example, including divorce, are inevitably related to disobeying God&rsquo;s plan for marriage and the family (7:1&ndash;40). Proper worship is determined by such things as recognition of God&rsquo;s holy character (3:17), the spiritual identity of the church (12:12&ndash;27) and pure partaking of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper (11:17&ndash;34). It is not possible for the church to be edified faithfully and effectively unless believers understand and exercise their spiritual gifts (12:1&ndash;14:40). The importance of the doctrine of the resurrection, of course, cannot be overestimated because if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen. And if Christ is not risen, then preaching is empty and so is faith (15:13, 14).</p><p>In addition to those themes, Paul deals briefly with God&rsquo;s judgment of believers, the right understanding of which will produce right motives for godly living (see 3:13&ndash;15). The right understanding of idols and of false gods, in general, was to help the immature Corinthians think maturely about such things as eating meat that had been sacrificed to idols (8:1&ndash;11:1). The right understanding and expression of genuine, godly love was mandatory to right use of the gifts and even to right knowledge about all the things of God (13:1&ndash;13).</p><p>So Paul deals with the cross, divine wisdom and human wisdom, the work of the Spirit in illumination, carnality, eternal rewards, the transformation of salvation, sanctification, the nature of Christ, union with Him, the divine role for women, marriage and divorce, Spirit baptism, indwelling and gifting, the unity of the church in one body, the theology of love, and the doctrine of resurrection. All these establish foundational truth for godly behavior.</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>By far the most controversial issue for interpretation is that of the sign gifts discussed in chaps. 12&ndash;14, particularly the gifts of miracles and tongues-speaking. Many believe that all the gifts are permanent, so that the gift of speaking in tongues will cease (13:8) only at the time the gifts of prophecy and of knowledge cease, namely, when that which is perfect has come (v. 10). Those who maintain that tongues and miracles are still valid spiritual gifts in the church today believe they should be exercised with the same power they were in NT times by the apostles. Others believe the miraculous sign gifts have ceased. This controversy will be resolved in the appropriate notes on chaps. 12&ndash;14.</p><p>The issue of divorce is a troubling one for many. Chapter 7 addresses the subject, but calls for careful interpretation to yield consistent biblical doctrine on the matter.</p><p>Advocates of universalism, the idea that all men will eventually be saved, use 15:22 in support of that view, claiming that, just as every human being died spiritually because of Adam&rsquo;s sin, they will all be saved through Christ&rsquo;s righteousness. The note on that verse will confront the challenge of such universalists.</p><p>From that same chapter, the obscure phrase &ldquo;baptized for the dead&rdquo; (v. 29) is used to defend the notion that a dead person can be saved by being baptized vicariously through a living Christian.

As the notes will point out, regardless of how that particular verse is interpreted, the falsehood of dead people having the opportunity to be saved is proven by many other texts that are indisputably clear.</p><p>A much less serious issue concerns the meaning of 6:4, which pertains to Christians taking other Christians to court before unbelievers.

"47","47","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>This is the second NT epistle the Apostle Paul wrote to the Christians in the city of Corinth (<a href=""http://www.gty.org/resources/Resources/Bible+Introductions/MSB46"">see Introduction to 1 Corinthians</a>).</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>That the Apostle Paul wrote 2 Corinthians is uncontested; the lack of any motive for a forger to write this highly personal, biographical epistle has led even the most critical scholars to affirm Paul as its author.</p><p>Several considerations establish a feasible date for the writing of this letter. Extrabiblical sources indicate that July, A.D. 51 is the most likely date for the beginning of Gallio&rsquo;s proconsulship (cf. Acts 18:12). Paul&rsquo;s trial before him at Corinth (Acts 18:12&ndash;17) probably took place shortly after Gallio assumed office. Leaving Corinth (probably in A.D. 52), Paul sailed for Palestine (Acts 18:18), thus concluding his second missionary journey. Returning to Ephesus on his third missionary journey (probably in A.D. 52), Paul ministered there for about 2 1/2 years (Acts 19:8, 10). The apostle wrote 1 Corinthians from Ephesus toward the close of that period (1 Cor. 16:8), most likely in A.D. 55. Since Paul planned to stay in Ephesus until the following spring (cf. the reference to Pentecost in 1 Cor. 16:8), and 2 Corinthians was written after he left Ephesus (see Background and Setting), the most likely date for 2 Corinthians is late A.D. 55 or very early A.D. 56.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>Paul&rsquo;s association with the important commercial city of Corinth (see Introduction to 1 Corinthians: Title) began on his second missionary journey (Acts 18:1&ndash;18), when he spent 18 months (Acts 18:11) ministering there. After leaving Corinth, Paul heard of immorality in the Corinthian church and wrote a letter (since lost) to confront that sin, referred to in 1 Cor. 5:9. During his ministry in Ephesus, he received further reports of trouble in the Corinthian church in the form of divisions among them (1 Cor. 1:11). In addition, the Corinthians wrote Paul a letter (1 Cor. 7:1) asking for clarification of some issues. Paul responded by writing the letter known as 1 Corinthians. Planning to remain at Ephesus a little longer (1 Cor. 16:8, 9), Paul sent Timothy to Corinth (1 Cor. 4:17; 16:10, 11). Disturbing news reached the apostle (possibly from Timothy) of further difficulties at Corinth, including the arrival of self-styled false apostles.</p><p>To create the platform to teach their false gospel, they began by assaulting the character of Paul. They had to convince the people to turn from Paul to them if they were to succeed in preaching demon doctrine. Temporarily abandoning the work at Ephesus, Paul went immediately to Corinth. The visit (known as the &ldquo;painful visit,&rdquo; 2:1) was not a successful one from Paul&rsquo;s perspective; someone in the Corinthian church (possibly one of the false apostles) even openly insulted him (2:5&ndash;8, 10; 7:12). Saddened by the Corinthians&rsquo; lack of loyalty to defend him, seeking to spare them further reproof (cf. 1:23), and perhaps hoping time would bring them to their senses, Paul returned to Ephesus. From Ephesus, Paul wrote what is known as the &ldquo;severe letter&rdquo; (2:4) and sent it with Titus to Corinth (7:5&ndash;16). Leaving Ephesus after the riot sparked by Demetrius (Acts 19:23&ndash;20:1), Paul went to Troas to meet Titus (2:12, 13). But Paul was so anxious for news of how the Corinthians had responded to the &ldquo;severe letter&rdquo; that he could not minister there though the Lord had opened the door (2:12; cf. 7:5). So he left for Macedonia to look for Titus (2:13). To Paul&rsquo;s immense relief and joy, Titus met him with the news that the majority of the Corinthians had repented of their rebellion against Paul (7:7). Wise enough to know that some rebellious attitudes still smoldered under the surface, and could erupt again, Paul wrote (possibly from Philippi, cf. 11:9 with Phil. 4:15; also, some early manuscripts list Philippi as the place of writing) the Corinthians the letter called 2 Corinthians. In this letter, though the apostle expressed his relief and joy at their repentance (7:8&ndash;16), his main concern was to defend his apostleship (chaps. 1&ndash;7), exhort the Corinthians to resume preparations for the collection for the poor at Jerusalem (chaps. 8, 9), and confront the false apostles head on (chaps. 10&ndash;13). He then went to Corinth, as he had written (12:14; 13:1, 2). The Corinthians&rsquo; participation in the Jerusalem offering (Rom. 15:26) implies that Paul&rsquo;s third visit to that church was successful.</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>Second Corinthians complements the historical record of Paul&rsquo;s dealings with the Corinthian church recorded in Acts and 1 Corinthians. It also contains important biographical data on Paul throughout.</p><p>Although an intensely personal letter, written by the apostle in the heat of battle against those attacking his credibility, 2 Corinthians contains several important theological themes. It portrays God the Father as a merciful comforter (1:3; 7:6), the Creator (4:6), the One who raised Jesus from the dead (4:14; cf. 13:4), and who will raise believers as well (1:9). Jesus Christ is the One who suffered (1:5), who fulfilled God&rsquo;s promises (1:20), who was the proclaimed Lord (4:5), who manifested God&rsquo;s glory (4:6), and the One who in His incarnation became poor for believers (8:9; cf. Phil. 2:5&ndash;8). The letter portrays the Holy Spirit as God (3:17, 18) and the guarantee of believers&rsquo; salvation (1:22; 5:5). Satan is identified as the &ldquo;god of this age&rdquo; (4:4; cf. 1 John 5:19), a deceiver (11:14), and the leader of human and angelic deceivers (11:15). The end times include both the believer&rsquo;s glorification (4:16&ndash;5:8) and his judgment (5:10). The glorious truth of God&rsquo;s sovereignty in salvation is the theme of 5:14&ndash;21, while 7:9, 10 sets forth man&rsquo;s response to God&rsquo;s offer of salvation-genuine repentance. Second Corinthians also presents the clearest, most concise summary of the substitutionary atonement of Christ to be found anywhere in Scripture (5:21; cf. Is. 53) and defines the mission of the church to proclaim reconciliation (5:18&ndash;20). Finally, the nature of the New Covenant receives its fullest exposition outside the book of Hebrews (3:6&ndash;16).</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>The main challenge confronting the interpreter is the relationship of chaps. 10&ndash;13 to chaps. 1&ndash;9. The identity of Paul&rsquo;s opponents at Corinth has produced various interpretations, as has the identity of the brother who accompanied Titus to Corinth (8:18, 22). Whether the offender mentioned in 2:5&ndash;8 is the incestuous man of 1 Cor. 5 is also uncertain. It is difficult to explain Paul&rsquo;s vision (12:1&ndash;5) and to identify specifically his &ldquo;thorn in the flesh,&rdquo; the &ldquo;messenger of Satan [sent] to buffet [him]&rdquo; (12:7). These and other interpretive problems will be dealt with in the notes on the appropriate passages.</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I.

"48","48","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>Galatians derives its title (pros Galatas) from the region in Asia Minor (modern Turkey) where the churches addressed were located. It is the only one of Paul&rsquo;s epistles specifically addressed to churches in more than one city (1:2; cf. 3:1; 1 Cor. 16:1).</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>There is no reason to question the internal claims that the apostle Paul wrote Galatians (1:1; 5:2). Paul was born in Tarsus, a city in the province of Cilicia, not far from Galatia. Under the famous rabbi, Gamaliel, Paul received a thorough training in the OT Scriptures and in the rabbinic traditions at Jerusalem (Acts 22:3). A member of the ultra-orthodox sect of the Pharisees (Acts 23:6), he was one of first-century Judaism&rsquo;s rising stars (1:14; cf. Phil. 3:5, 6).</p><p>The course of Paul&rsquo;s life took a sudden and startling turn when, on his way to Damascus from Jerusalem to persecute Christians, he was confronted by the risen, glorified Christ. That dramatic encounter turned Paul from Christianity&rsquo;s chief persecutor to its greatest missionary. His 3 missionary journeys and trip to Rome turned Christianity from a faith that included only a small group of Palestinian Jewish believers into an Empire-wide phenomenon. Galatians is one of 13 inspired letters he addressed to Gentile congregations or his fellow workers. For further biographical information on Paul, see Introduction to Romans: Author and Date.</p><p>In chap. 2, Paul described his visit to the Jerusalem Council of Acts 15 (see note on 2:1), so he must have written Galatians after that event. Since most scholars date the Jerusalem Council about A.D. 49, the most likely date for Galatians is shortly thereafter.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>In Paul&rsquo;s day, the word Galatia had two distinct meanings. In a strict ethnic sense, Galatia was the region of central Asia Minor inhabited by the Galatians. They were a Celtic people who had migrated to that region from Gaul (modern France) in the third century B.C. The Romans conquered the Galatians in 189 B.C. but allowed them to have some measure of independence until 25 B.C. when Galatia became a Roman province, incorporating some regions not inhabited by ethnic Galatians (e.g., parts of Lycaonia, Phrygia, and Pisidia). In a political sense, Galatia came to describe the entire Roman province, not merely the region inhabited by the ethnic Galatians.</p><p>Paul founded churches in the southern Galatian cities of Antioch, Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe (Acts 13:14&ndash;14:23). These cities, although within the Roman province of Galatia, were not in the ethnic Galatian region. There is no record of Paul&rsquo;s founding churches in that northern, less populated region.</p><p>Those two uses of the word Galatia make it more difficult to determine who the original recipients of the epistle were. Some interpret Galatia in its strict racial sense and argue that Paul addressed this epistle to churches in the northern Galatian region, inhabited by the ethnic descendants of the Gauls. Although the apostle apparently crossed the border into the fringes of ethnic Galatia on at least two occasions (Acts 16:6; 18:23), Acts does not record that he founded any churches or engaged in any evangelistic ministry there.</p><p>Because neither Acts nor Galatians mentions any cities or people from northern (ethnic) Galatia, it is reasonable to believe that Paul addressed this epistle to churches located in the southern part of the Roman province, but outside of the ethnic Galatian region. Acts records the apostle&rsquo;s founding of such churches at Pisidian Antioch (13:14&ndash;50), Iconium (13:51&ndash;14:7; cf. 16:2), Lystra (14:8&ndash;19; cf. 16:2), and Derbe (14:20, 21; cf. 16:1). In addition, the churches Paul addressed had apparently been established before the Jerusalem Council (2:5), and the churches of southern Galatia fit that criterion, having been founded during Paul&rsquo;s first missionary journey before the Council met. Paul did not visit northern (ethnic) Galatia until after the Jerusalem Council (Acts 16:6).</p><p>Paul wrote Galatians to counter judaizing false teachers who were undermining the central NT doctrine of justification by faith. Ignoring the express decree of the Jerusalem Council (Acts 15:23&ndash;29), they spread their dangerous teaching that Gentiles must first become Jewish proselytes and submit to all the Mosaic law before they could become Christians (see 1:7; 4:17, 21; 5:2&ndash;12; 6:12, 13). Shocked by the Galatians&rsquo; openness to that damning heresy (cf. 1:6), Paul wrote this letter to defend justification by faith, and warn these churches of the dire consequences of abandoning that essential doctrine. Galatians is the only epistle Paul wrote that does not contain a commendation for its readers&mdash;that obvious omission reflects how urgently he felt about confronting the defection and defending the essential doctrine of justification.</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>Galatians provides valuable historical information about Paul&rsquo;s background (chaps. 1, 2), including his 3-year stay in Nabatean Arabia (1:17, 18), which Acts does not mention; his 15-day visit with Peter after his stay in Arabia (1:18, 19); his trip to the Jerusalem Council (2:1&ndash;10); and his confrontation of Peter (2:11&ndash;21).</p><p>As already noted, the central theme of Galatians (like that of Romans) is justification by faith. Paul defends that doctrine (which is the heart of the gospel) both in its theological (chaps. 3, 4) and practical (chaps. 5, 6) ramifications. He also defends his position as an apostle (chaps. 1, 2) since, as in Corinth, false teachers had attempted to gain a hearing for their heretical teaching by undermining Paul&rsquo;s credibility. The main theological themes of Galatians are strikingly similar to those of Romans, e.g., the inability of the law to justify (2:16; cf. Rom. 3:20); the believer&rsquo;s deadness to the law (2:19; cf. Rom. 7:4); the believer&rsquo;s crucifixion with Christ (2:20; cf. Rom. 6:6); Abraham&rsquo;s justification by faith (3:6; cf. Rom. 4:3); that believers are Abraham&rsquo;s spiritual children (3:7; cf. Rom. 4:10, 11) and therefore blessed (3:9; cf. Rom. 4:23, 24); that the law brings not salvation but God&rsquo;s wrath (3:10; cf. Rom. 4:15); that the just shall live by faith (3:11; cf. Rom. 1:17); the universality of sin (3:22; cf. Rom. 11:32); that believers are spiritually baptized into Christ (3:27; cf. Rom. 6:3); believers&rsquo; adoption as God&rsquo;s spiritual children (4:5&ndash;7; cf. Rom. 8:14&ndash;17); that love fulfills the law (5:14; cf. Rom. 13:8&ndash;10); the importance of walking in the Spirit (5:16; cf. Rom. 8:4); the warfare of the flesh against the Spirit (5:17; cf. Rom. 7:23, 25); and the importance of believers bearing one anothers&rsquo; burdens (6:2; cf. Rom. 15:1).</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>First, Paul described a visit to Jerusalem and a subsequent meeting with Peter, James, and John (2:1&ndash;10). There is a question to be resolved in that text, as to whether that was his visit to the Jerusalem Council (Acts 15), or his earlier visit bringing famine relief to the Jerusalem church (Acts 11:27&ndash;30). Second, those who teach baptismal regeneration (the false doctrine that baptism is necessary for salvation) support their view from 3:27. Third, others have used this epistle to support their attacks on the biblical roles of men and women, claiming that the spiritual equality taught in 3:28 is incompatible with the traditional concept of authority and submission. Fourth, those who reject the doctrine of eternal security argue that the phrase &ldquo;you have fallen from grace&rdquo; (5:4) describes believers who lost their salvation. Fifth, there is disagreement whether Paul&rsquo;s statement &ldquo;see with what large letters I have written to you with my own hand!&rdquo; refers to the entire letter, or merely the concluding verses. Finally, many claim that Paul erased the line between Israel and the church when he identified the church as the &ldquo;Israel of God&rdquo; (6:16). Those challenges will be addressed in the notes to the appropriate passages.</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I. Personal: The Preacher of Justification (1:1&ndash;2:21)</strong></p><p>A.

"49","49","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>The letter is addressed to the church in the city of Ephesus, capital of the Roman province of Asia (Asia Minor, modern Turkey). Because the name Ephesus is not mentioned in every early manuscript, some scholars believe the letter was an encyclical, intended to be circulated and read among all the churches in Asia Minor and was simply sent first to believers in Ephesus.</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>There is no indication that the authorship of Paul should be in question. He is indicated as author in the opening salutation (1:1; 3:1). The letter was written from prison in Rome (Acts 28:16&ndash;31) sometime between A.D. 60&ndash;62 and is, therefore, often referred to as a prison epistle (along with Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon). It may have been composed almost contemporaneously with Colossians and initially sent with that epistle and Philemon by Tychicus (Eph. 6:21, 22; Col. 4:7, 8). See Introduction to Philippians: Author and Date for a discussion of the city from which Paul wrote.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>It is likely that the gospel was first brought to Ephesus by Priscilla and Aquila, an exceptionally gifted couple (see Acts 18:26) who were left there by Paul on his second missionary journey (Acts 18:18, 19). Located at the mouth of the Cayster River, on the east side of the Aegean Sea, the city of Ephesus was perhaps best known for its magnificent temple of Artemis, or Diana, one of the 7 wonders of the ancient world. It was also an important political, educational, and commercial center, ranking with Alexandria in Egypt, and Antioch of Pisidia, in southern Asia Minor.</p><p>The fledgling church begun by Priscilla and Aquila was later firmly established by Paul on his third missionary journey (Acts 19) and was pastored by him for some 3 years. After Paul left, Timothy pastored the congregation for perhaps a year and a half, primarily to counter the false teaching of a few influential men (such as Hymenaeus and Alexander), who were probably elders in the congregation there (1 Tim. 1:3, 20). Because of those men, the church at Ephesus was plagued by &ldquo;fables and endless genealogies&rdquo; (1:4) and by such ascetic and unscriptural ideas as the forbidding of marriage and abstaining from certain foods (4:3). Although those false teachers did not rightly understand Scripture, they propounded their ungodly interpretations with confidence (1:7), which produced in the church harmful &ldquo;disputes rather than godly edification which is in faith&rdquo; (1:4). Thirty years or so later, Christ gave to the Apostle John a letter for this church indicating its people had left their first love for Him (Rev. 2:1&ndash;7).</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>The first 3 chapters are theological, emphasizing NT doctrine, whereas the last 3 chapters are practical and focus on Christian behavior. Perhaps, above all, this is a letter of encouragement and admonition, written to remind believers of their immeasurable blessings in Jesus Christ; and not only to be thankful for those blessings, but also to live in a manner worthy of them. Despite, and partly even because of, a Christian&rsquo;s great blessings in Jesus Christ, he is sure to be tempted by Satan to self-satisfaction and complacency. It was for that reason that, in the last chapter, Paul reminds believers of the full and sufficient spiritual armor supplied to them through God&rsquo;s Word and by His Spirit (6:10&ndash;17) and of their need for vigilant and persistent prayer (6:18).</p><p>A key theme of the letter is the mystery (meaning a heretofore unrevealed truth) of the church, which is &ldquo;that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, of the same body, and partakers of His promise in Christ through the gospel&rdquo; (3:6), a truth completely hidden from the OT saints (cf. 3:5, 9). All believers in Jesus Christ, the Messiah, are equal before the Lord as His children and as citizens of His eternal kingdom, a marvelous truth that only believers of this present age possess. Paul also speaks of the mystery of the church as the bride of Christ (5:32; cf. Rev. 21:9).</p><p>A major truth emphasized is that of the church as Christ&rsquo;s present spiritual, earthly body, also a distinct and formerly unrevealed truth about God&rsquo;s people. This metaphor depicts the church, not as an organization, but as a living organism composed of mutually related and interdependent parts. Christ is Head of the body and the Holy Spirit is its lifeblood, as it were. The body functions through the faithful use of its members&rsquo; various spiritual gifts, sovereignly and uniquely bestowed by the Holy Spirit on each believer.</p><p>Other major themes include the riches and fullness of blessing to believers. Paul writes of &ldquo;the riches of His [God&rsquo;s] grace (1:7), &ldquo;the unsearchable riches of Christ&rdquo; (3:8), and &ldquo;the riches of His glory&rdquo; (3:16). Paul admonishes believers to &ldquo;be filled with all the fullness of God&rdquo; (3:19), to &ldquo;come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ&rdquo; (4:13), and to &ldquo;be filled with the Spirit&rdquo; (5:18). Their riches in Christ are based on His grace (1:2, 6, 7; 2:7), His peace (1:2), His will (1:5), His pleasure and purpose (1:9), His glory (1:12, 14), His calling and inheritance (1:18), His power and strength (1:19; 6:10), His love (2:4), His workmanship (2:10), His Holy Spirit (3:16), His offering and sacrifice (5:2), and His armor (6:11, 13). The word &ldquo;riches&rdquo; is used 5 times in this letter; &ldquo;grace&rdquo; is used 12 times; &ldquo;glory&rdquo; 8 times; &ldquo;fullness&rdquo; or &ldquo;filled&rdquo; 6 times; and the key phrase &ldquo;in Christ&rdquo; (or &ldquo;in Him&rdquo;) some 12 times.</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>The general theology of Ephesians is direct, unambiguous, and presents no ideas or interpretations whose meanings are seriously contended. There are, however, some texts that require careful thought to rightly interpret, namely: 1) 2:8, in which one must decide if the salvation or the faith is the gift; 2) 4:5, in which the type of baptism must be discerned; and 3) 4:8, in its relationship to Ps. 68:18.</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I.

"50","50","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>Philippians derives its name from the Greek city where the church to which it was addressed was located. Philippi was the first town in Macedonia where Paul established a church.</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>The unanimous testimony of the early church was that the Apostle Paul wrote Philippians. Nothing in the letter would have motivated a forger to write it.</p><p>The question of when Philippians was written cannot be separated from that of where it was written. The traditional view is that Philippians, along with the other Prison Epistles (Ephesians, Colossians, Philemon), was written during Paul&rsquo;s first imprisonment at Rome (ca. A.D. 60&ndash;62). The most natural understanding of the references to the &ldquo;palace guard&rdquo; (1:13) and the &ldquo;saints &hellip; of Caesar&rsquo;s household&rdquo; (4:22) is that Paul wrote from Rome, where the emperor lived. The similarities between the details of Paul&rsquo;s imprisonment given in Acts and in the Prison Epistles also argue that those epistles were written from Rome (e.g., Paul was guarded by soldiers, Acts 28:16; cf. 1:13, 14; was permitted to receive visitors, Acts 28:30; cf. 4:18; and had the opportunity to preach the gospel, Acts 28:31; cf. 1:12&ndash;14; Eph. 6:18&ndash;20; Col. 4:2&ndash;4).</p><p>Some have held that Paul wrote the Prison Epistles during his two-year imprisonment at Caesarea (Acts 24:27). But Paul&rsquo;s opportunities to receive visitors and proclaim the gospel were severely limited during that imprisonment (cf. Acts 23:35). The Prison Epistles express Paul&rsquo;s hope for a favorable verdict (1:25; 2:24; cf. Philem. 22). In Caesarea, however, Paul&rsquo;s only hope for release was either to bribe Felix (Acts 24:26), or agree to stand trial at Jerusalem under Festus (Acts 25:9). In the Prison Epistles, Paul expected the decision in his case to be final (1:20&ndash;23; 2:17, 23). That could not have been true at Caesarea, since Paul could and did appeal his case to the emperor.</p><p>Another alternative has been that Paul wrote the Prison Epistles from Ephesus. But at Ephesus, like Caesarea, no final decision could be made in his case because of his right to appeal to the emperor. Also, Luke was with Paul when he wrote Colossians (Col. 4:14), but he apparently was not with the apostle at Ephesus. Acts 19, which records Paul&rsquo;s stay in Ephesus, is not in one of the &ldquo;we sections&rdquo; of Acts (see Introduction to Acts: Author and Date). The most telling argument against Ephesus as the point of origin for the Prison Epistles, however, is that there is no evidence that Paul was ever imprisoned at Ephesus.</p><p>In light of the serious difficulties faced by both the Caesarean and Ephesian views, there is no reason to reject the traditional view that Paul wrote the Prison Epistles&mdash;including Philippians&mdash;from Rome.</p><p>Paul&rsquo;s belief that his case would soon be decided (2:23, 24) points to Philippians being written toward the close of the apostle&rsquo;s two-year Roman imprisonment (ca. A.D. 61).</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>Originally known as Krenides (&ldquo;The Little Fountains&rdquo;) because of the numerous nearby springs, Philippi (&ldquo;city of Philip&rdquo;) received its name from Philip II of Macedon (the father of Alexander the Great). Attracted by the nearby gold mines, Philip conquered the region in the fourth century B.C. In the second century B.C., Philippi became part of the Roman province of Macedonia.</p><p>The city existed in relative obscurity for the next two centuries until one of the most famous events in Roman history brought it recognition and expansion. In 42 B.C., the forces ofAntony and Octavian defeated those of Brutus and Cassius at the Battle of Philippi, thusending the Roman Republic and ushering in the Empire. After the battle, Philippi became aRoman colony (cf. Acts 16:12), and many veterans of the Roman army settled there. As acolony, Philippi had autonomy from the provincial government and the same rights grantedto cities in Italy, including the use of Roman law, exemption from some taxes, and Romancitizenship for its residents (Acts 16:21). Being a colony was also the source of much civicpride for the Philippians, who used Latin as their official language, adopted Roman customs,and modeled their city government after that of Italian cities. Acts and Philippians both reflect Philippi&rsquo;s status as a Roman colony.</p><p>Paul&rsquo;s description of Christians as citizens of heaven (3:20) was appropriate, since the Philippians prided themselves on being citizens of Rome (cf. Acts 16:21). The Philippians may well have known some of the members of the palace guard (1:13) and Caesar&rsquo;s household (4:22).</p><p>The church at Philippi, the first one founded by Paul in Europe, dates from the apostle&rsquo;s second missionary journey (Acts 16:12&ndash;40). Philippi evidently had a very small Jewish population. Because there were not enough men to form a synagogue (the requirement was for 10 Jewish men who were heads of a household), some devout women met outside the city at a place of prayer (Acts 16:13) alongside the Gangites River. Paul preached the gospel to them and Lydia, a wealthy merchant dealing in expensive purple dyed goods (Acts 16:14), became a believer (16:14, 15). It is likely that the Philippian church initially met in her spacious home.</p><p>Satanic opposition to the new church immediately arose in the person of a demonpossessed, fortune-telling slave girl (Acts 16:16, 17). Not wanting even agreeable testimony from such an evil source, Paul cast the demon out of her (Acts 16:18). The apostle&rsquo;s act enraged the girl&rsquo;s masters, who could no longer sell her services as a fortune-teller (Acts 16:19). They hauled Paul and Silas before the city&rsquo;s magistrates (Acts 16:20) and inflamed the civic pride of the Philippians by claiming the two preachers were a threat to Roman customs (Acts 16:20, 21). As a result, Paul and Silas were beaten and imprisoned (Acts 16:22&ndash;24).</p><p>The two preachers were miraculously released from prison that night by an earthquake, which unnerved the jailer and opened his heart and that of his household to the gospel (Acts 16:25&ndash;34). The next day the magistrates, panicking when they learned they had illegally beaten and imprisoned two Roman citizens, begged Paul and Silas to leave Philippi.</p><p>Paul apparently visited Philippi twice during his third missionary journey, once at the beginning (cf. 2 Cor. 8:1&ndash;5), and again near the end (Acts 20:6). About 4 or 5 years after his last visit to Philippi, while a prisoner at Rome, Paul received a delegation from the Philippian church. The Philippians had generously supported Paul in the past (4:15, 16), and had also contributed abundantly for the needy at Jerusalem (2 Cor. 8:1&ndash;4). Now, hearing of Paul&rsquo;s imprisonment, they sent another contribution to him (4:10), and along with it Epaphroditus to minister to Paul&rsquo;s needs. Unfortunately Epaphroditus suffered a near-fatal illness (2:26, 27), either while en route to Rome, or after he arrived. Accordingly, Paul decided to send Epaphroditus back to Philippi (2:25, 26) and wrote the letter to the Philippians to send back with him.</p><p>Paul had several purposes in composing this epistle. First, he wanted to express in writing his thanks for the Philippians&rsquo; gift (4:10&ndash;18). Second, he wanted the Philippians to know why he decided to return Epaphroditus to them, so they would not think his service to Paul had been unsatisfactory (2:25, 26). Third, he wanted to inform them about his circumstances at Rome (1:12&ndash;26). Fourth, he wrote to exhort them to unity (2:1, 2; 4:2). Finally, he wrote to warn them against false teachers (3:1&ndash;4:1).</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>Since it is primarily a practical letter, Philippians contains little historical material (there are no OT quotes), apart from the momentous treatment of Paul&rsquo;s spiritual autobiography (3:4&ndash;7). There is, likewise, little direct theological instruction, also with one momentous exception.<br />The magnificent passage describing Christ&rsquo;s humiliation and exaltation (2:5&ndash;11) contains some of the most profound and crucial teaching on the Lord Jesus Christ in all the Bible. The major theme of pursuing Christlikeness, as the most defining element of spiritual growth and the one passion of Paul in his own life, is presented in 3:12&ndash;14. In spite of Paul&rsquo;s imprisonment, the dominant tone of the letter is joyful (1:4, 18, 25, 26; 2:2, 16&ndash;18, 28; 3:1, 3; 4:1, 4, 10).</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>The major difficulty connected with Philippians is determining where it was written (see Author and Date). The text itself presents only one significant interpretive challenge: the identity of the &ldquo;enemies of the cross&rdquo; (see notes on 3:18, 19).</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I.

"51","51","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>Colossians is named for the city of Colosse, where the church it was addressed to was located. It was also to be read in the neighboring church at Laodicea (4:16).</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>Paul is identified as author at the beginning (1:1; cf. v. 23; 4:18), as customarily in his epistles. The testimony of the early church, including such key figures as Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, Origen, and Eusebius, confirms that the opening claim is genuine. Additional evidence for Paul&rsquo;s authorship comes from the book&rsquo;s close parallels with Philemon, which is universally accepted as having been written by Paul. Both were written (ca. A.D. 60&ndash;62) while Paul was a prisoner in Rome (4:3, 10, 18; Philem. 9, 10, 13, 23); plus the names of the same people (e.g., Timothy, Aristarchus, Archippus, Mark, Epaphras, Luke, Onesimus, and Demas) appear in both epistles, showing that both were written by the same author at about the same time. For biographical information on Paul see Introduction to Romans: Author and Date.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>Colosse was a city in Phrygia, in the Roman province of Asia (part of modern Turkey), about 100 mi. E of Ephesus in the region of the 7 churches of Rev. 1&ndash;3. The city lay alongside the Lycus River, not far from where it flowed into the Maender River. The Lycus Valley narrowed at Colosse to a width of about two mi., and Mt. Cadmus rose 8,000 feet above the city.</p><p>Colosse was a thriving city in the fifth century B.C. when the Persian king Xerxes (Ahasuerus, cf. Esth. 1:1) marched through the region. Black wool and dyes (made from the nearby chalk deposits) were important products. In addition, the city was situated at the junction of the main north-south and east-west trade routes. By Paul&rsquo;s day, however, the main road had been rerouted through nearby Laodicea, thus bypassing Colosse and leading to its decline and the rise of the neighboring cities of Laodicea and Hierapolis.</p><p>Although Colosse&rsquo;s population was mainly Gentile, there was a large Jewish settlement dating from the days of Antiochus the Great (223&ndash;187 B.C.). Colosse&rsquo;s mixed population of Jews and Gentiles manifested itself both in the composition of the church and in the heresy that plagued it, which contained elements of both Jewish legalism and pagan mysticism.</p><p>The church at Colosse began during Paul&rsquo;s 3-year ministry at Ephesus (Acts 19). Its founder was not Paul, who had never been there (2:1); but Epaphras (1:5&ndash;7), who apparently was saved during a visit to Ephesus, then likely started the church in Colosse when he returned home. Several years after the Colossian church was founded, a dangerous heresy arose to threaten it&mdash;one not identified with any particular historical system. It contained elements of what later became known as Gnosticism: that God is good, but matter is evil, that Jesus Christ was merely one of a series of emanations descending from God and being less than God (a belief that led them to deny His true humanity), and that a secret, higher knowledge above Scripture was necessary for enlightenment and salvation. The Colossian heresy also embraced aspects of Jewish legalism, e.g., the necessity of circumcision for salvation, observance of the ceremonial rituals of the OT law (dietary laws, festivals, Sabbaths), and rigid asceticism. It also called for the worship of angels and mystical experience. Epaphras was so concerned about this heresy that he made the long journey from Colosse to Rome (4:12, 13), where Paul was a prisoner.</p><p>This letter was written from prison in Rome (Acts 28:16&ndash;31) sometime between A.D. 60&ndash;62 and is, therefore, referred to as a Prison Epistle (along with Ephesians, Philippians, and Philemon). It may have been composed almost contemporaneously with Ephesians and initially sent with that epistle and Philemon by Tychicus (Eph. 6:21, 22; Col. 4:7, 8). See Introduction to Philippians: Author and Date for a discussion of the city from which Paul wrote. He wrote this letter to warn the Colossians against the heresy they faced, and sent the letter to them with Tychicus, who was accompanying the runaway slave Onesimus back to his master, Philemon, a member of the Colossian church (4:7&ndash;9; see Introduction to Philemon: Background and Setting). Epaphras remained behind in Rome (cf. Philem. 23), perhaps to receive further instruction from Paul.</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>Colossians contains teaching on several key areas of theology, including the deity of Christ (1:15&ndash;20; 2:2&ndash;10), reconciliation (1:20&ndash;23), redemption (1:13, 14; 2:13, 14; 3:9&ndash;11), election (3:12), forgiveness (3:13), and the nature of the church (1:18, 24, 25; 2:19; 3:11, 15). Also, as noted above, it refutes the heretical teaching that threatened the Colossian church (chap. 2).</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>Those cults that deny Christ&rsquo;s deity have seized upon the description of Him as &ldquo;the firstborn over all creation&rdquo; (1:15) as proof that He was a created being. Paul&rsquo;s statement that believers will be &ldquo;holy, and blameless, and above reproach&rdquo; if they &ldquo;continue in the faith&rdquo; (1:22, 23) has led some to teach that believers can lose their salvation. Some have argued for the existence of purgatory based on Paul&rsquo;s statement, &ldquo;I &hellip; fill up in my flesh what is lacking in the afflictions of Christ&rdquo; (1:24), while others see support for baptismal regeneration (2:12). The identity of the &ldquo;epistle from Laodicea&rdquo; (4:16) has also prompted much discussion.</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I. Personal Matters (1:1&ndash;14)</strong></p><p>A.

"52","52","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>In the Greek NT, 1 Thessalonians is listed literally as &ldquo;To the Thessalonians.&rdquo; This represents the Apostle Paul&rsquo;s first canonical correspondence to the church in the city of Thessalonica (cf.1:1).</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>The Apostle Paul identified himself twice as the author of this letter (1:1; 2:18). Silvanus (Silas) and Timothy (3:2,6), Paul&rsquo;s traveling companions on the second missionary journey when the church was founded (Acts 17:1&ndash;9), were also mentioned in Paul&rsquo;s greeting (1:1).<br />Though Paul was the single inspired author, most of the first person plural pronouns (we, us, our) refer to all 3. However, during Timothy&rsquo;s visit back to Thessalonica, they refer only to Paul and Silvanus (3:1,2,6). Paul commonly used such editorial plurals because the letters came<br />with the full support of his companions.</p><p>Paul&rsquo;s authorship has not been questioned until recently by radical critics. Their attempts to undermine Pauline authorship has failed in light of the combined weight of evidence favoring Paul such as: 1) the direct assertions of Paul&rsquo;s authorship (1:1; 2:18); 2) the letter&rsquo;s perfect correlation with Paul&rsquo;s travels in Acts 16&ndash;18; 3) the multitude of intimate details regarding Paul; and 4) the confirmation by multiple, early historical verifications starting with Marcion&rsquo;s canon in A.D. 140.</p><p>The first of Paul&rsquo;s two letters written from Corinth to the church at Thessalonica is datedca. A.D. 51. This date has been archeologically verified by an inscription in the temple of Apollos at Delphi (near Corinth) which dates Gallio&rsquo;s service as proconsul in Achaia to A.D. 51&ndash;52 (Acts 18:12&ndash;17). Since Paul&rsquo;s letter to the churches of Galatia was probably written ca. A.D. 49&ndash;50, this was his second piece of canonical correspondence.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>Thessalonica (modern Salonica) lies near the ancient site of Therma on the Thermaic Gulf at the northern reaches of the Aegean Sea. This city became the capital of Macedonia (ca. 168 B.C.) and enjoyed the status of a &ldquo;free city&rdquo; which was ruled by its own citizenry (Acts 17:6) under the Roman Empire. Because it was located on the main east-west highway, Via Egnatia, Thessalonica served as the hub of political and commercial activity in Macedonia, and became known as &ldquo;the mother of all Macedonia.&rdquo; The population in Paul&rsquo;s day reached 200,000 people.</p><p>Paul had originally traveled 100 mi. from Philippi via Amphipolis and Apollonia to Thessalonica on his second missionary journey (A.D. 50; Acts 16:1&ndash;18:22). As his custom was upon arrival, he sought out the synagogue in which to teach the local Jews the gospel (Acts 17:1,2). On that occasion, he dialogued with them from the OT concerning Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection in order to prove that Jesus of Nazareth was truly the promised Messiah (Acts 17:2,3). Some Jews believed and soon after, Hellenistic proselytes and some wealthy women of the community also were converted (Acts 17:4). Mentioned among these new believers were Jason (Acts 17:5), Gaius (Acts 19:29), Aristarchus (Acts 20:4), and Segundus (Acts 20:4).</p><p>Because of their effective ministry, the Jews had Paul&rsquo;s team evicted from the city (Acts 17:5&ndash;9), so they went south to evangelize Berea (Acts 17:10). There Paul had a similar experience to Thessalonica with conversions followed by hostility, so the believers sent Paul away. He headed for Athens, while Silvanus and Timothy remained in Berea (Acts 17:11&ndash;14). They rejoined Paul in Athens (cf. Acts 17:15,16 with 3:1), from which Timothy was later dispatched back to Thessalonica (3:2). Apparently, Silas afterwards traveled from Athens to Philippi while Paul journeyed on alone to Corinth (Acts 18:1). It was after Timothy and Silvanus rejoined Paul in Corinth (Acts 18:5), that he wrote 1 Thessalonians in response to Timothy&rsquo;s good report of the church.</p><p>Paul undoubtedly had multiple reasons for writing, all coming out of his supreme concern for the flock from which he had been separated. Some of Paul&rsquo;s purposes clearly included: 1) encouraging the church (1:2&ndash;10); 2) answering false allegations (2:1&ndash;12); 3) comforting the persecuted flock (2:13&ndash;16); 4) expressing his joy in their faith (2:17&ndash;3:13); 5) reminding them of the importance of moral purity (4:1&ndash;8); 6) condemning the sluggard lifestyle (4:9&ndash;12); 7) correcting a wrong understanding of prophetic events (4:13&ndash;5:11); 8) defusing tensions within the flock (5:12&ndash;15); and 9) exhorting the flock in the basics of Christian living (5:16&ndash;22).</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>Both letters to Thessalonica have been referred to as &ldquo;the eschatological epistles.&rdquo; However, in light of their more extensive focus upon the church, they would better be categorized as the church epistles. Five major themes are woven together in 1 Thessalonians: 1) an apologetic theme with the historical correlation between Acts and 1 Thessalonians; 2) an ecclesiastical theme with the portrayal of a healthy, growing church; 3) a pastoral theme with the example of shepherding activities and attitudes; 4) an eschatological theme with the focus on future events as the church&rsquo;s hope; and 5) a missionary theme with the emphasis on gospel proclamation and church planting.</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>Primarily the challenges for understanding this epistle involve the sections that are eschatological in nature: 1) the coming wrath (1:10; 5:9); 2) Christ&rsquo;s return (2:19; 3:13; 4:15; 5:23); 3) the rapture of the church (4:13&ndash;18); and 4) the meaning and time of the Day of the Lord (5:1&ndash;11).</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I.

"53","53","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>In the Greek NT, 2 Thessalonians is listed as &ldquo;To the Thessalonians.&rdquo; This represents the Apostle Paul&rsquo;s second canonical correspondence to the fellowship of believers in the city of Thessalonica (cf. 1:1).</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>Paul, as in 1 Thessalonians, identified himself twice as the author of this letter (1:1; 3:17). Silvanus (Silas) and Timothy, Paul&rsquo;s co-laborers in founding the church, were present with him when he wrote. Evidence, both within this letter and with regard to vocabulary, style, and doctrinal content, strongly supports Paul as the only possible author. The time of this writing was surely a few months after the first epistle, while Paul was still in Corinth with Silas and Timothy (1:1; Acts 18:5) in late A.D. 51 or early A.D. 52 (<a href=""http://www.gty.org/resources/Resources/Bible+Introductions/MSB52"">see Introduction to 1 Thessalonians</a>: Author and Date).</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>For the history of Thessalonica, see Introduction to 1 Thessalonians: Background and Setting. Some have suggested that Paul penned this letter from Ephesus (Acts 18:18&ndash;21), but his 18 month stay in Corinth provided ample time both for the Thessalonian epistles to be authored (Acts 18:11).</p><p>Apparently, Paul had stayed appraised of the happenings in Thessalonica through correspondence and/or couriers. Perhaps the bearer of the first letter brought Paul back an update on the condition of the church, which had matured and expanded (1:3); but pressure and persecution had also increased. The seeds of false doctrine concerning the Lord had been sown, and the people were behaving disorderly. So Paul wrote to his beloved flock who were: 1) discouraged by persecution and needed incentive to persevere; 2) deceived by false teachers who confused them about the Lord&rsquo;s return; and 3) disobedient to divine commands, particularly by refusing to work. Paul wrote to address those 3 issues by offering: 1) comfort for the persecuted believers (1:3&ndash;12); 2) correction for the falsely taught and frightened believers (2:1&ndash;15); and 3) confrontation for the disobedient and undisciplined believers (3:6&ndash;15).</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>Although chaps. 1,2 contain much prophetic material because the main issue was a serious misunderstanding generated by false teachers about the coming Day of the Lord (Paul reveals that the Day had not come and would not until certain other events occur), it is still best to call this &ldquo;a pastoral letter.&rdquo; The emphasis is on how to maintain a healthy church with an effective testimony in proper response to sound eschatology and obedience to the truth.</p><p>Eschatology dominates the theological issues. One of the clearest statements on personal eschatology for unbelievers is found in 1:9.

"54","54","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>This is the first of two inspired letters Paul wrote to his beloved son in the faith. Timothy received his name, which means &ldquo;one who honors God,&rdquo; from his mother (Eunice) and grandmother (Lois), devout Jews who became believers in the Lord Jesus Christ (2 Tim. 1:5) and taught Timothy the OT Scriptures from his childhood (2 Tim. 3:15). His father was a Greek (Acts 16:1) who may have died before Timothy met Paul.</p><p>Timothy was from Lystra (Acts 16:1&ndash;3), a city in the Roman province of Galatia (part of modern Turkey). Paul led Timothy to Christ (1:2,18; 1 Cor. 4:17; 2 Tim. 1:2), undoubtedly during his ministry in Lystra on his first missionary journey (Acts 14:6&ndash;23). When he revisited Lystra on his second missionary journey, Paul chose Timothy to accompany him (Acts 16:1&ndash;3). Although Timothy was very young (probably in his late teens or early twenties, since about 15 years later Paul referred to him as a young man, 4:12), he had a reputation for godliness (Acts 16:2). Timothy was to be Paul&rsquo;s disciple, friend, and co-laborer for the rest of the apostle&rsquo;s life, ministering with him in Berea (Acts 17:14), Athens (Acts 17:15), Corinth (Acts 18:5; 2 Cor. 1:19), and accompanying him on his trip to Jerusalem (Acts 20:4). He was with Paul in his first Roman imprisonment and went to Philippi (2:19&ndash;23) after Paul&rsquo;s release. In addition, Paul frequently mentions Timothy in his epistles (Rom. 16:21; 2 Cor. 1:1; Phil. 1:1; Col. 1:1; 1 Thess. 1:1; 2 Thess. 1:1; Philem. 1). Paul often sent Timothy to churches as his representative (1 Cor. 4:17; 16:10; Phil. 2:19; 1 Thess. 3:2), and 1 Timothy finds him on another assignment, serving as pastor of the church at Ephesus (1:3). According to Heb. 13:23, Timothy was imprisoned somewhere and released.</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>Many modernist critics delight in attacking the plain statements of Scripture and, for no good reason, deny that Paul wrote the Pastoral Epistles (1, 2 Tim., Titus). Ignoring the testimony of the letters themselves (1:1; 2 Tim. 1:1; Titus 1:1) and that of the early church (which is as strong for the Pastoral Epistles as for any of Paul&rsquo;s epistles, except Rom. and 1 Cor.), these critics maintain that a devout follower of Paul wrote the Pastoral Epistles in the second century. As proof, they offer 5 lines of supposed evidence: 1) The historical references in the Pastoral Epistles cannot be harmonized with the chronology of Paul&rsquo;s life given in Acts; 2) The false teaching described in the Pastoral Epistles is the fully- developed Gnosticism of the second century; 3) The church organizational structure in the Pastoral Epistles is that of the second century, and is too well developed for Paul&rsquo;s day; 4) The Pastoral Epistles do not contain the great themes of Paul&rsquo;s theology; 5) The Greek vocabulary of the Pastoral Epistles contains many words not found in Paul&rsquo;s other letters, nor in the rest of the NT.</p><p>While it is unnecessary to dignify such unwarranted attacks by unbelievers with an answer, occasionally such an answer does enlighten. Thus, in reply to the critics&rsquo; arguments, it can be pointed out that: 1) This contention of historical incompatibility is valid only if Paul was never released from his Roman imprisonment mentioned in Acts. But he was released, since Acts does not record Paul&rsquo;s execution, and Paul himself expected to be released (Phil. 1:19,25,26; 2:24; Philem. 22). The historical events in the Pastoral Epistles do not fit into the chronology of Acts because they happened after the close of the Acts narrative which ends with Paul&rsquo;s first imprisonment in Rome. 2) While there are similarities between the heresy of the Pastoral Epistles and second-century Gnosticism (<a href=""http://www.gty.org/resources/Resources/Bible+Introductions/MSB51"">see Introduction to Colossians</a>: Background and Setting), there are also important differences. Unlike second-century Gnosticism, the false teachers of the Pastoral Epistles were still within the church (cf. 1:3&ndash;7) and their teaching was based on Judaistic legalism (1:7; Titus 1:10,14; 3:9). 3) The church organizational structure mentioned in the Pastoral Epistles is, in fact, consistent with that established by Paul (Acts 14:23; Phil. 1:1). 4) The Pastoral Epistles do mention the central themes of Paul&rsquo;s theology, including the inspiration of Scripture (2 Tim. 3:15&ndash;17); election (2 Tim. 1:9; Titus 1:1,2); salvation (Titus 3:5&ndash;7); the deity of Christ (Titus 2:13); His mediatorial work (2:5), and substitutionary atonement (2:6). 5) The different subject matter in the Pastoral Epistles required a different vocabulary from that in Paul&rsquo;s other epistles. Certainly a pastor today would use a different vocabulary in a personal letter to a fellow pastor than he would in a work of systematic theology.</p><p>The idea that a &ldquo;pious forger&rdquo; wrote the Pastoral Epistles faces several further difficulties: 1) The early church did not approve of such practices and surely would have exposed this as a ruse, if there had actually been one (cf. 2 Thess. 2:1,2; 3:17). 2) Why forge 3 letters that include similar material and no deviant doctrine? 3) If a counterfeit, why not invent an itinerary for Paul that would have harmonized with Acts? 4) Would a later, devoted follower of Paul have put the words of 1:13,15 into his master&rsquo;s mouth? 5) Why would he include warnings against<br />deceivers (2 Tim. 3:13; Titus 1:10), if he himself were one?</p><p>The evidence seems clear that Paul wrote 1 Timothy and Titus shortly after his release from his first Roman imprisonment (ca. A.D. 62&ndash;64), and 2 Timothy from prison during his second Roman imprisonment (ca. A.D. 66&ndash;67), shortly before his death.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>After being released from his first Roman imprisonment (cf. Acts 28:30), Paul revisited several of the cities in which he had ministered, including Ephesus. Leaving Timothy behind there to deal with problems that had arisen in the Ephesian church, such as false doctrine (1:3&ndash;7; 4:1&ndash;3; 6:3&ndash;5), disorder in worship (2:1&ndash;15), the need for qualified leaders (3:1&ndash;14), and materialism (6:6&ndash;19), Paul went on to Macedonia, from where he wrote Timothy this letter to help him carry out his task in the church (cf. 3:14,15).</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>First Timothy is a practical letter containing pastoral instruction from Paul to Timothy (cf. 3:14,15). Since Timothy was well versed in Paul&rsquo;s theology, the apostle had no need to give him extensive doctrinal instruction. This epistle does, however, express many important theological truths, such as the proper function of the law (1:5&ndash;11), salvation (1:14&ndash;16; 2:4&ndash;6); the attributes of God (1:17); the Fall (2:13,14); the person of Christ (3:16; 6:15,16); election (6:12); and the second coming of Christ (6:14,15).</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>There is disagreement over the identity of the false teachers (1:3) and the genealogies (1:4) involved in their teaching. What it means to be &ldquo;delivered to Satan&rdquo; (1:20) has also been a source of debate. The letter contains key passages in the debate over the extent of the atonement (2:4&ndash;6; 4:10). Paul&rsquo;s teaching on the role of women (2:9&ndash;15) has generated much discussion, particularly his declaration that they are not to assume leadership roles in the church (2:11,12). How women can be saved by bearing children (2:15) has also confused many. Whether the fact that an elder must be &ldquo;the husband of one wife&rdquo; excludes divorced or unmarried men has been disputed, as well as whether Paul refers to deacons&rsquo; wives or deaconesses (3:11). Those who believe Christians can lose their salvation cite 4:1 as support for their view. There is a question about the identity of the widows in 5:3&ndash;16&mdash;are they needy women ministered to by the church, or an order of older women ministering to the church? Does &ldquo;double honor&rdquo; accorded to elders who rule well (5:17,18) refer to respect or money? These will all be dealt with in their respective notes.</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I. Greeting (1:1, 2)</strong></p><p><strong>II.

"55","55","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>This epistle is the second of two inspired letters Paul the apostle wrote to his son in the faith, Timothy (1:2; 2:1). For biographical information on Timothy, <a href=""http://www.gty.org/resources/Resources/Bible+Introductions/MSB54"">see Introduction to 1 Timothy</a>: Title. It is titled, as are the other personal letters of Paul to individuals (1 Timothy, Titus, and Philemon), with the name of the addressee (1:2).</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>The issue of Paul&rsquo;s authorship of the Pastoral Epistles is discussed in the Introduction to 1 Timothy: Author and Date. Paul wrote 2 Timothy, the last of his inspired letters, shortly before his martyrdom (ca. A.D. 67).</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>Paul was released from his first Roman imprisonment for a short period of ministry during which he wrote 1 Timothy and Titus. Second Timothy, however, finds Paul once again in a Roman prison (1:16; 2:9), apparently rearrested as part of Nero&rsquo;s persecution of Christians. Unlike Paul&rsquo;s confident hope of release during his first imprisonment (Phil. 1:19,25,26; 2:24; Philem. 22), this time he had no such hopes (4:6&ndash;8). In his first imprisonment in Rome (ca. A.D. 60&ndash;62), before Nero had begun the persecution of Christians (A.D. 64), he was only under house arrest and had opportunity for much interaction with people and ministry (Acts 28:16&ndash;31). At this time, 5 or 6 years later (ca. A.D. 66&ndash;67), however, he was in a cold cell (4:13), in chains (2:9), and with no hope of deliverance (4:6). Abandoned by virtually all of those close to him for fear of persecution (cf. 1:15; 4:9&ndash;12,16) and facing imminent execution, Paul wrote to Timothy, urging him to hasten to Rome for one last visit with the apostle (4:9,21). Whether Timothy made it to Rome before Paul&rsquo;s execution is not known. According to tradition, Paul was not released from this second Roman imprisonment, but suffered the martyrdom he had foreseen (4:6).</p><p>In this letter, Paul, aware the end was near, passed the non-apostolic mantle of ministry to Timothy (cf. 2:2) and exhorted him to continue faithful in his duties (1:6), hold on to sound doctrine (1:13,14), avoid error (2:15&ndash;18), accept persecution for the gospel (2:3,4; 3:10&ndash;12), put his confidence in the Scripture, and preach it relentlessly (3:15&ndash;4:5).</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>It seems that Paul may have had reason to fear that Timothy was in danger of weakening spiritually. This would have been a grave concern for Paul since Timothy needed to carry on Paul&rsquo;s work (cf. 2:2). While there are no historical indications elsewhere in the NT as to why Paul was so concerned, there is evidence in the epistle itself from what he wrote. This concern is evident, for example, in Paul&rsquo;s exhortation to &ldquo;stir up&rdquo; his gift (1:6), to replace fear with power, love, and a sound mind (1:7), to not be ashamed of Paul and the Lord, but willingly suffer for the gospel (1:8), and to hold on to the truth (1:13,14). Summing up the potential problem of Timothy, who might be weakening under the pressure of the church and the persecution of the world, Paul calls him to 1) generally &ldquo;be strong&rdquo; (2:11), the key exhortation of the first part of the letter, and to 2) continue to &ldquo;preach the word&rdquo; (4:2), the main admonition of the last part. These final words to Timothy include few commendations but many admonitions, including about 25 imperatives.</p><p>Since Timothy was well versed in Paul&rsquo;s theology, the apostle did not instruct him further doctrinally. He did, however, allude to several important doctrines, including salvation by God&rsquo;s sovereign grace (1:9,10; 2:10), the person of Christ (2:8; 4:1,8), and perseverance (2:11&ndash; 13); plus Paul wrote the crucial text of the NT on the inspiration of Scripture (3:16,17).</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>There are no major challenges in this letter involving theological issues. There is limited data regarding several individuals named in the epistle; e.g., Phygellus and Hermogenes (1:15), Onesiphorus (1:17; cf. 4:19), Hymenaeus and Philetus (2:17,18), Jannes and Jambres (3:8), and Alexander (4:14).</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I.

"56","56","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>This epistle is named for its recipient, Titus, who is mentioned by name 13 times in the NT (1:4; Gal. 2:1,3; 2 Tim 4:10; for the 9 times in 2 Cor., see Background and Setting). The title in the Greek NT literally reads &ldquo;To Titus.&rdquo; Along with 1, 2 Timothy, these letters to Paul&rsquo;s sons in the faith are traditionally called &ldquo;The Pastoral Epistles.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>Authorship by the Apostle Paul (1:1) is essentially uncontested (<a href=""http://www.gty.org/resources/Resources/Bible+Introductions/MSB54"">see Introduction to 1 Timothy</a>). Titus was written between A.D. 62&ndash;64, while Paul ministered to Macedonian churches between his first and second Roman imprisonments, from either Corinth or Nicopolis (cf. 3:12). Most likely, Titus served with Paul on both the second and third missionary journeys. Titus, like Timothy (2 Tim. 1:2), had become a beloved disciple (1:4) and fellow worker in the gospel (2 Cor. 8:23). Paul&rsquo;s last mention of Titus (2 Tim. 4:10) reports that he had gone for ministry in Dalmatia&mdash;modern Yugoslavia. The letter probably was delivered by Zenas and Apollos (3:13).</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>Although Luke did not mention Titus by name in the book of Acts, it seems probable that Titus, a Gentile (Gal. 2:3), met and may have been led to faith in Christ by Paul (1:4) before or during the apostle&rsquo;s first missionary journey. Later, Titus ministered for a period of time with Paul on the Island of Crete and was left behind to continue and strengthen the work (1:5). After Artemas or Tychicus (3:12) arrived to direct the ministry there, Paul wanted Titus to join him in the city of Nicopolis, in the province of Achaia in Greece, and stay through the winter (3:12).</p><p>Because of his involvement with the church at Corinth during Paul&rsquo;s third missionary journey, Titus is mentioned 9 times in 2 Corinthians (2:13; 7:6,13,14; 8:6,16,23; 12:18), where Paul refers to him as &ldquo;my brother&rdquo; (2:13) and &ldquo;my partner and fellow worker&rdquo; (8:23). The young elder was already familiar with Judaizers, false teachers in the church, who among other things insisted that all Christians, Gentile as well as Jew, were bound by the Mosaic law. Titus had accompanied Paul and Barnabas years earlier to the Council of Jerusalem where that heresy was the subject (Acts 15; Gal. 2:1&ndash;5).</p><p>Crete, one of the largest islands in the Mediterranean Sea, measuring 160 miles long by 35 miles at its widest, lying south of the Aegean Sea, had been briefly visited by Paul on his voyage to Rome (Acts 27:7&ndash;9,12,13,21). He returned there for ministry and later left Titus to continue the work, much as he left Timothy at Ephesus (1 Tim. 1:3), while he went on to Macedonia. He most likely wrote to Titus in response to a letter from Titus or a report from Crete.</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>Like Paul&rsquo;s two letters to Timothy, the apostle gives personal encouragement and counsel to a young pastor who, though well-trained and faithful, faced continuing opposition from ungodly men within the churches where he ministered. Titus was to pass on that encouragement and counsel to the leaders he was to appoint in the Cretan churches (1:5).</p><p>In contrast to several of Paul&rsquo;s other letters, such as those to the churches in Rome and Galatia, the book of Titus does not focus on explaining or defending doctrine. Paul had full confidence in Titus&rsquo; theological understanding and convictions, evidenced by the fact that he entrusted him with such a demanding ministry. Except for the warning about false teachers and Judaizers, the letter gives no theological correction, strongly suggesting that Paul also had confidence in the doctrinal grounding of most church members there, despite the fact that the majority of them were new believers. Doctrines that this epistle affirms include: 1) God&rsquo;s sovereign election of believers (1:1,2); 2) His saving grace (2:11; 3:5); 3) Christ&rsquo;s deity and second coming (2:13); 4) Christ&rsquo;s substitutionary atonement (2:14); and 5) the regeneration and renewing of believers by the Holy Spirit (3:5).</p><p>God and Christ are regularly referred to as Savior (1:3,4; 2:10,13; 3:4,6) and the saving plan is so emphasized in 2:11&ndash;14 that it indicates the major thrust of the epistle is that of equipping the churches of Crete for effective evangelism. This preparation required godly leaders who not only would shepherd believers under their care (1:5&ndash;9), but also would equip those Christians for evangelizing their pagan neighbors, who had been characterized by one of their own famous natives as liars, evil beasts, and lazy gluttons (1:12). In order to gain a hearing for the gospel among such people, the believers&rsquo; primary preparation for evangelization was to live among themselves with the unarguable testimony of righteous, loving, selfless, and godly lives (2:2&ndash;14) in marked contrast to the debauched lives of the false teachers (1:10&ndash;16). How they behaved with reference to governmental authorities and unbelievers was also crucial to their testimony (3:1&ndash;8).</p><p>Several major themes repeat themselves throughout Titus. They include: work(s) (1:16; 2:7,14; 3:1,5,8,14); soundness in faith and doctrine (1:4,9,13; 2:1,2,7,8,10; 3:15); and salvation (1:3,4; 2:10,13; 3:4,6).</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>The letter to Titus presents itself in a straightforward manner which should be taken at face value. The few interpretive challenges include: 1) Are the children of 1:6 merely &ldquo;faithful&rdquo; or are they &ldquo;believing&rdquo;? and 2) What is the &ldquo;blessed hope&rdquo; of 2:13?</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I.

"57","57","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>Philemon, the recipient of this letter, was a prominent member of the church at Colosse (vv. 1,2; cf. Col. 4:9), which met in his house (v. 2). The letter was for him, his family, and the church.</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>The book claims that the Apostle Paul was its writer (vv. 1,9,19), a claim that few in the history of the church have disputed, especially since there is nothing in Philemon that a forger would have been motivated to write. It is one of the Prison Epistles, along with Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians. Its close connection with Colossians, which Paul wrote at the same time (ca. A.D. 60&ndash;62; cf. vv. 1,16), brought early and unquestioned vindication of Paul&rsquo;s authorship by the early church fathers (e.g., Jerome, Chrysostom, and Theodore of Mopsuestia). The earliest of NT canons, the Muratorian (ca. A.D. 170), includes Philemon. For biographical information on Paul, see Introduction to <a href=""http://www.gty.org/resources/Resources/Bible+Introductions/MSB45"">Romans</a>: Author and Date; for the date and place of Philemon&rsquo;s writing, see Introductions to <a href=""http://www.gty.org/resources/Resources/Bible+Introductions/MSB49"">Ephesians</a> and <a href=""http://www.gty.org/resources/Resources/Bible+Introductions/MSB50"">Philippians</a>: Author and Date.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>Philemon had been saved under Paul&rsquo;s ministry, probably at Ephesus (v. 19), several years earlier. Wealthy enough to have a large house (cf. v. 2), Philemon also owned at least one slave, a man named Onesimus (lit.&ldquo;useful&rdquo;; a common name for slaves). Onesimus was not a believer at the time he stole some money (v. 18) from Philemon and ran away. Like countless thousands of other runaway slaves, Onesimus fled to Rome, seeking to lose himself in the Imperial capital&rsquo;s teeming and nondescript slave population. Through circumstances not recorded in Scripture, Onesimus met Paul in Rome and became a Christian. The apostle quickly grew to love the runaway slave (vv. 12,16) and longed to keep Onesimus in Rome (v. 13), where he was providing valuable service to Paul in his imprisonment (v. 11). But by stealing and running away from Philemon, Onesimus had both broken Roman law and defrauded his master. Paul knew those issues had to be dealt with, and decided to send Onesimus back to Colosse. It was too hazardous for him to make the trip alone (because of the danger of slave-catchers), so Paul sent him back with Tychicus, who was returning to Colosse with the epistle to the Colossians (Col. 4:7&ndash;9). Along with Onesimus, Paul sent Philemon this beautiful personal letter, urging him to forgive Onesimus and welcome him back to service as a brother in Christ (vv. 15&ndash;17).</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>Philemon provides valuable historical insights into the early church&rsquo;s relationship to the institution of slavery. Slavery was widespread in the Roman Empire (according to some estimates, slaves constituted one third, perhaps more, of the population) and an accepted part of life. In Paul&rsquo;s day, slavery had virtually eclipsed free labor. Slaves could be doctors, musicians, teachers, artists, librarians, or accountants; in short, almost all jobs could be and were filled by slaves.</p><p>Slaves were not legally considered persons, but were the tools of their masters. As such, they could be bought, sold, inherited, exchanged, or seized to pay their master&rsquo;s debt. Their masters had virtually unlimited power to punish them, and sometimes did so severely for the slightest infractions. By the time of the NT, however, slavery was beginning to change. Realizing that contented slaves were more productive, masters tended to treat them more leniently. It was not uncommon for a master to teach a slave his own trade, and some masters and slaves became close friends. While still not recognizing them as persons under the law, the Roman Senate in A.D. 20 granted slaves accused of crimes the right to a trial. It also became more common for slaves to be granted (or to purchase) their freedom. Some slaves enjoyed very favorable and profitable service under their masters and were better off than many freemen because they were assured of care and provision. Many freemen struggled in poverty.</p><p>The NT nowhere directly attacks slavery; had it done so, the resulting slave insurrections would have been brutally suppressed and the message of the gospel hopelessly confused with that of social reform. Instead, Christianity undermined the evils of slavery by changing the hearts of slaves and masters. By stressing the spiritual equality of master and slave (v. 16; Gal. 3:28; Eph. 6:9; Col. 4:1; 1 Tim. 6:1,2), the Bible did away with slavery&rsquo;s abuses. The rich theological theme that alone dominates the letter is forgiveness, a featured theme throughout NT Scripture (cf. Matt. 6:12&ndash;15; 18:21&ndash;35; Eph. 4:32; Col. 3:13). Paul&rsquo;s instruction here provides the biblical definition of forgiveness, without ever using the word.</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>There are no significant interpretive challenges in this personal letter from Paul to his friend Philemon.</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I.

"58","58","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>When the various NT books were formally brought together into one collection shortly after A.D. 100, the titles were added for convenience. This epistle&rsquo;s title bears the traditional Greek title, &ldquo;To the Hebrews,&rdquo; which was attested by at least the second century A.D. Within the epistle itself, however, there is no identification of the recipients as either Hebrews (Jews) or Gentiles. Since the epistle is filled with references to Hebrew history and religion and does not address any particular Gentile or pagan practice, the traditional title has been maintained.</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>The author of Hebrews is unknown. Paul, Barnabas, Silas, Apollos, Luke, Philip, Priscilla, Aquila, and Clement of Rome have been suggested by different scholars, but the epistle&rsquo;s vocabulary, style, and various literary characteristics do not clearly support any particular claim. It is significant that the writer includes himself among those people who had received confirmation of Christ&rsquo;s message from others (2:3). That would seem to rule out someone like Paul who claimed that he had received such confirmation directly from God and not from men (Gal. 1:12). Whoever the author was, he preferred citing OT references from the Greek OT (LXX) rather than from the Hebrew text. Even the early church expressed various opinions on authorship, and current scholarship admits the puzzle still has no solution. Therefore, it seems best to accept the epistle&rsquo;s anonymity. Ultimately, of course, the author was the Holy Spirit (2 Pet. 1:21).</p><p>The use of the present tense in 5:1&ndash;4; 7:21,23,27,28; 8:3&ndash;5,13; 9:6&ndash;9,13,25; 10:1,3,4,8,11; and 13:10,11 would suggest that the Levitical priesthood and sacrificial system were still in operation when the epistle was composed. Since the temple was destroyed by General (later Emperor) Titus Vespasian in A.D. 70, the epistle must have been written prior to that date. In addition, it may be noted that Timothy had just been released from prison (13:23) and that persecution was becoming severe (10:32&ndash;39; 12:4; 13:3). These details suggest a date for the epistle around A.D. 67&ndash;69.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>Emphases on the Levitical priesthood and on sacrifices, as well as the absence of any reference to the Gentiles, support the conclusion that a community of Hebrews was the recipient of the epistle. Although these Hebrews were primarily converts to Christ, there were probably a number of unbelievers in their midst, who were attracted by the message of salvation, but who had not yet made a full commitment of faith in Christ (see Interpretive Challenges). One thing is clear from the contents of the epistle: the community of Hebrews was facing the possibility of intensified persecution (10:32&ndash;39; 12:4). As they confronted this possibility, the Hebrews were tempted to cast aside any identification with Christ. They may have considered demoting Christ from God&rsquo;s Son to a mere angel. Such a precedent had already been set in the Qumran community of messianic Jews living near the Dead Sea. They had dropped out of society, established a religious commune, and included the worship of angels in their brand of reformed Judaism. The Qumran community had even gone so far as to claim that the angel Michael was higher in status than the coming Messiah. These kinds of doctrinal aberrations could explain the emphasis in Hebrews chapter one on the superiority of Christ over the angels.</p><p>Possible locations for the recipients of the epistle include Palestine, Egypt, Italy, Asia Minor, and Greece. The community that was the primary recipient may have circulated the epistle among those of Hebrew background in neighboring areas and churches. Those believers probably had not seen Christ personally. Apparently, they had been evangelized by &ldquo;those who heard&rdquo; Christ and whose ministries had been authenticated &ldquo;with signs and wonders, with various miracles&rdquo; (2:3,4). Thus the recipients could have been in a church outside Judea and Galilee or in a church in those areas, but established among people in the generation following those who had been eyewitnesses of Christ. The congregation was not new or untaught (&ldquo;by this time you ought to be teachers&rdquo;) yet some of them still needed &ldquo;milk and not solid food&rdquo; (5:12).</p><p>&ldquo;Those from Italy&rdquo; (13:24) is an ambiguous reference since it could mean either those who had left Italy and were living elsewhere, or those who were still in Italy and being singled out as native residents of that country. Greece or Asia Minor must also be considered because of the apparently early establishment of the church there, and because of the consistent use of the LXX.</p><p>The generation of Hebrews receiving this epistle had practiced the Levitical sacrifices at the temple in Jerusalem. Jews living in exile had substituted the synagogue for the temple but still felt a deep attraction to the temple worship. Some had the means to make regular pilgrimages to the temple in Jerusalem. The writer of this epistle emphasized the superiority of Christianity over Judaism and the superiority of Christ&rsquo;s once-for-all sacrifice over the repeated and imperfect Levitical sacrifices observed in the temple.</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>Since the book of Hebrews is grounded in the work of the Levitical priesthood, an understanding of the book of Leviticus is essential for properly interpreting Hebrews. Israel&rsquo;s sin had continually interrupted God&rsquo;s fellowship with His chosen and covenant people, Israel. Therefore, He graciously and sovereignly established a system of sacrifices that symbolically represented the inner repentance of sinners and His divine forgiveness. However, the need for sacrifices never ended because the people and priests continued to sin. The need of all mankind was for a perfect priest and a perfect sacrifice that would once and for all actually remove sin. God&rsquo;s provision for that perfect priest and sacrifice in Christ is the central message of Hebrews.</p><p>The epistle to the Hebrews is a study in contrast, between the imperfect and incomplete provisions of the Old Covenant, given under Moses, and the infinitely better provisions of the New Covenant offered by the perfect High-Priest, God&rsquo;s only Son and the Messiah, Jesus Christ. Included in the &ldquo;better&rdquo; provisions are: a better hope, testament, promise, sacrifice, substance, country, and resurrection. Those who belong to the New Covenant dwell in a completely new and heavenly atmosphere, they worship a heavenly Savior, have a heavenly calling, receive a heavenly gift, are citizens of a heavenly country, look forward to a heavenly Jerusalem, and have their very names written in heaven.</p><p>One of the key theological themes in Hebrews is that all believers now have direct access to God under the New Covenant and, therefore, may approach the throne of God boldly (4:16; 10:22). One&rsquo;s hope is in the very presence of God, into which he follows the Savior (6:19,20; 10:19,20). The primary teaching symbolized by the tabernacle service was that believers under the covenant of law did not have direct access to the presence of God (9:8), but were shut out of the Holy of Holies. The book of Hebrews may briefly be summarized in this way: Believers in Jesus Christ, as God&rsquo;s perfect sacrifice for sin, have the perfect High-Priest through whose ministry everything is new and better than under the covenant of law.</p><p>This epistle is more than a doctrinal treatise, however. It is intensely practical in its application to everyday living (see chap. 13). The writer himself even refers to his letter as a &ldquo;word of exhortation&rdquo; (13:22; cf. Acts 13:15). Exhortations designed to stir the readers into action are found throughout the text. Those exhortations are given in the form of 6 warnings:</p><blockquote><p>Warning against drifting from &ldquo;the things we have heard&rdquo; (2:1&ndash;4)</p><p>Warning against disbelieving the &ldquo;voice&rdquo; of God (3:7&ndash;14)</p><p>Warning against degenerating from &ldquo;the elementary principles of Christ&rdquo; (5:11&ndash;6:20)</p><p>Warning against despising &ldquo;the knowledge of the truth&rdquo; (10:26&ndash;39)</p><p>Warning against devaluing &ldquo;the grace of God&rdquo; (12:15&ndash;17)</p><p>Warning against departing from Him &ldquo;who speaks&rdquo; (12:25&ndash;29)</p></blockquote><p>Another significant aspect of this epistle is its clear exposition of selected OT passages. The writer was clearly a skilled expositor of the Word of God. His example is instructive for preachers and teachers:</p><blockquote><p>1:1 and 2:4 Exposition of verses from Pss.; 2 Sam. 7; Deut. 32</p><p>2:5 and 18 Exposition of Ps. 8:4 and 6</p><p>3:1 and 4:13 Exposition of Ps. 95:7 and 11</p><p>4:14 and 7:28 Exposition of Ps. 110:4</p><p>8:1 and 10:18 Exposition of Jer. 31:31 and 34</p><p>10:32 and 12:3 Exposition of Hab. 2:3,4</p><p>12:4 and 13 Exposition of Prov. 3:11,12</p><p>12:18 and 29 Exposition of Ex. 19, 20</p></blockquote><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>A proper interpretation of this epistle requires the recognition that it addresses 3 distinct groups of Jews: 1) believers; 2) unbelievers who were intellectually convinced of the gospel; and 3) unbelievers who were attracted by the gospel and the person of Christ but who had reached no final conviction about Him. Failure to acknowledge these groups leads to interpretations inconsistent with the rest of Scripture.</p><p>The primary group addressed were Hebrew Christians who suffered rejection and persecution by fellow Jews (10:32&ndash;34), although none as yet had been martyred (12:4). The letter was written to give them encouragement and confidence in Christ, their Messiah and High-Priest. They were an immature group of believers who were tempted to hold on to the symbolic and spiritually powerless rituals and traditions of Judaism.</p><p>The second group addressed were Jewish unbelievers who were convinced of the basic truths of the gospel but who had not placed their faith in Jesus Christ as their own Savior and Lord. They were intellectually persuaded but spiritually uncommitted. These unbelievers are addressed in such passages as 2:1&ndash;3; 6:4&ndash;6; 10:26&ndash;29; and 12:15&ndash;17.</p><p>The third group addressed were Jewish unbelievers who were not convinced of the gospel&rsquo;s truth but had had some exposure to it. Chapter 9 is largely devoted to them (see especially vv. 11,14,15,27,28).</p><p>By far, the most serious interpretive challenge is found in 6:4&ndash;6. The phrase &ldquo;once enlightened&rdquo; is often taken to refer to Christians, and the accompanying warning taken to indicate the danger of losing their salvation if &ldquo;they fall away&rdquo; and &ldquo;crucify again for themselves the Son of God.&rdquo; But there is no mention of their being saved and they are not described with any terms that apply only to believers (such as holy, born again, righteous, or saints). This problem arises from inaccurately identifying the spiritual condition of the ones being addressed. In this case, they were unbelievers who had been exposed to God&rsquo;s redemptive truth, and perhaps made a profession of faith, but had not exercised genuine saving faith. In 10:26, the reference once again is to apostate Christians, not to genuine believers who are often incorrectly thought to lose their salvation because of their sins.</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I.

"59","59","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>James, like all of the general epistles except Hebrews, is named after its author (v. 1).</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>Of the 4 men named James in the NT, only two are candidates for authorship of this epistle. No one has seriously considered James the Less, the son of Alphaeus (Matt. 10:3; Acts 1:13), or James the father of Judas, not Iscariot (Luke 6:16; Acts 1:13). Some have suggested James the son of Zebedee and brother of John (Matt. 4:21), but he was martyred too early to have written it (Acts 12:2). That leaves only James, the oldest half-brother of Christ (Mark 6:3) and brother of Jude (Matt. 13:55), who also wrote the epistle that bears his name (Jude 1). James had at first rejected Jesus as Messiah (John 7:5), but later believed (1 Cor. 15:7). He became the key leader in the Jerusalem church (cf. Acts 12:17; 15:13; 21:18; Gal. 2:12), being called one of the &ldquo;pillars&rdquo; of that church, along with Peter and John (Gal. 2:9). Also known as James the Just because of his devotion to righteousness, he was martyred ca. A.D. 62, according to the first century Jewish historian Josephus. Comparing James&rsquo; vocabulary in the letter he wrote which is recorded in Acts 15 with that in the epistle of James further corroborates his authorship.</p><blockquote><p><strong>James Acts 15</strong></p><p>1:1 &ldquo;greetings&rdquo; 15:23</p><p>1:16,19; 2:5 &ldquo;beloved&rdquo; 15:25</p><p>1:21; 5:20 &ldquo;your souls&rdquo; 15:24,26</p><p>1:27 &ldquo;visit&rdquo; 15:14</p><p>2:10          &ldquo;keep&rdquo; 15:24</p><p>5:19,20 &ldquo;turn&rdquo; 15:19</p></blockquote><p>James wrote with the authority of one who had personally seen the resurrected Christ (1 Cor. 15:7), who was recognized as an associate of the apostles (Gal. 1:19), and who was the leader of the Jerusalem church.</p><p>James most likely wrote this epistle to believers scattered (1:1) as a result of the unrest recorded in Acts 12 (ca. A.D. 44). There is no mention of the Council of Jerusalem described in Acts 15 (ca. A.D. 49), which would be expected if that Council had already taken place. Therefore, James can be reliably dated ca. A.D. 44&ndash;49, making it the earliest written book of the NT canon.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>The recipients of this book were Jewish believers who had been dispersed (1:1), possibly as a result of Stephen&rsquo;s martyrdom (Acts 7, A.D. 31&ndash;34), but more likely due to the persecution under Herod Agrippa I (Acts 12, ca. A.D. 44). The author refers to his audience as &ldquo;brethren&rdquo; 15 times (1:2,16,19; 2:1,5,14; 3:1,10,12; 4:11; 5:7,9,10,12,19), which was a common epithet among the first century Jews. Not surprisingly, then, James is Jewish in its content. For example, the Greek word translated &ldquo;assembly&rdquo; (2:2) is the word for &ldquo;synagogue.&rdquo; Further, James contains more than 40 allusions to the OT (and more than 20 to the Sermon on the Mount, Matt. 5&ndash;7).</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>James, with its devotion to direct, pungent statements on wise living, is reminiscent of the book of Proverbs. It has a practical emphasis, stressing not theoretical knowledge, but godly behavior. James wrote with a passionate desire for his readers to be uncompromisingly obedient to the Word of God. He used at least 30 references to nature (e.g., &ldquo;wave of the sea&rdquo; [1:6]; &ldquo;reptile&rdquo; [3:7]; and &ldquo;heaven gave rain&rdquo; [5:18]), as befits one who spent a great deal of time outdoors. He complements Paul&rsquo;s emphasis on justification by faith with his own emphasis on spiritual fruitfulness demonstrating true faith.</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>At least two significant texts challenge the interpreter: 1) In 2:14&ndash;26, what is the relationship between faith and works? Does James&rsquo; emphasis on works contradict Paul&rsquo;s focus on faith? 2) In 5:13&ndash;18, do the promises of healing refer to the spiritual or physical realm?</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p>There are a number of ways to outline the book to grasp the arrangement of its content. One way is to arrange it around a series of tests by which the genuineness of a person&rsquo;s faith may be measured.</p><p><strong>Introduction (1:1)</strong></p><p><strong>I.

"60","60","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>The letter has always been identified (as are most general epistles, like <a href=""http://www.gty.org/resources/Resources/Bible+Introductions/MSB59"">James</a>, <a href=""http://www.gty.org/resources/Resources/Bible+Introductions/MSB43"">John</a>, and <a href=""http://www.gty.org/resources/Resources/Bible+Introductions/MSB43"">Jude</a>) with the name of the author, Peter, and with the notation that it was his first inspired letter.</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>The opening verse of the epistle claims it was written by Peter, who was clearly the leader among Christ&rsquo;s apostles. The gospel writers emphasize this fact by placing his name at the head of each list of apostles (Matt. 10; Mark 3; Luke 6; Acts 1), and including more information about him in the 4 gospels than any person other than Christ. Originally known as Simon or Simeon, cf. Mark 1:16; John 1:40,41, Peter was the son of Jonas (Matt. 16:17) who was also known as John (John 1:42), and a member of a family of fishermen who lived in Bethsaida and later in Capernaum. Andrew, Peter&rsquo;s brother, brought him to Christ (John 1:40&ndash;42). He was married, and his wife apparently accompanied him in his ministry (Mark 1:29&ndash;31; 1 Cor. 9:5).</p><p>Peter was called to follow Christ in His early ministry (Mark 1:16,17), and was later appointed to apostleship (Matt. 10:2; Mark 3:14&ndash;16). Christ renamed him Peter, or Cephas, both words meaning &ldquo;stone&rdquo; or &ldquo;rock&rdquo; (John 1:42). The Lord clearly singled out Peter for special lessons throughout the gospels (e.g., Matt. 10; 16:13&ndash;21; 17:1&ndash;9; 24:1&ndash;7; 26:31&ndash;33; John 6:6; 21:3&ndash;7,15&ndash;17). He was the spokesman for the 12, articulating their thoughts and questions as well as his own. His triumphs and weaknesses are chronicled in the gospels and Acts 1&ndash;12.</p><p>After the resurrection and ascension, Peter initiated the plan for choosing a replacement for Judas (Acts 1:15). After the coming of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:1&ndash;4), he was empowered to become the leading gospel preacher from the Day of Pentecost on (Acts 2:12). He also performed notable miracles in the early days of the church (Acts 3&ndash;9), and opened the door of the gospel to the Samaritans (Acts 8) and to the Gentiles (Acts 10). According to tradition, Peter had to watch as his wife was crucified, but encouraged her with the words, &ldquo;Remember the Lord.&rdquo; When it came time for him to be crucified, he reportedly pled that he was not worthy to be crucified like his Lord, but rather should be crucified upside down (ca. A.D. 67&ndash;68), which tradition says he was.</p><p>Because of his unique prominence, there was no shortage in the early church of documents falsely claiming to be written by Peter. That the Apostle Peter is the author of 1 Peter, however, is certain. The material in this letter bears definite resemblance to his messages in the book of Acts. The letter teaches, for example, that Christ is the Stone rejected by the builder (2:7,8; Acts 4:10,11), and that Christ is no respecter of persons (1:17; Acts 10:34). Peter teaches his readers to &ldquo;gird yourself with humility&rdquo; (5:5), an echo of the Lord&rsquo;s girding Himself with a towel and washing the disciples&rsquo; feet (John 13:3&ndash;5). There are other statements in the letter similar to Christ&rsquo;s sayings (4:14; 5:7,8). Moreover, the author claims to have been a witness of the sufferings of Christ (5:1; cf. 3:18; 4:1). In addition to these internal evidences, it is noteworthy that the early Christians universally recognized this letter as the work of Peter.</p><p>The only significant doubt to be raised about Peter&rsquo;s authorship arises from the rather classical style of Greek employed in the letter. Some have argued that Peter, being an &ldquo;unlearned&rdquo; fisherman (Acts 4:13), could not have written in sophisticated Greek, especially in light of the less classical style of Greek employed in the writing of 2 Peter. However, this argument is not without a good answer. In the first place, that Peter was &ldquo;unlearned&rdquo; does not mean that he was illiterate, but only that he was without formal, rabbinical training in the Scriptures. Moreover, though Aramaic may have been Peter&rsquo;s primary language, Greek would have been a widely spoken second language in Palestine. It is also apparent that at least some of the authors of the NT, though not highly educated, could read the Greek of the OT Septuagint (see James&rsquo; use of the LXX in Acts 15:14&ndash;18).</p><p>Beyond these evidences of Peter&rsquo;s ability in Greek, Peter also explained (5:12) that he wrote this letter &ldquo;by Silvanus,&rdquo; also known as Silas. Silvanus was likely the messenger designated to take this letter to its intended readers. But more is implied by this statement in that Peter is acknowledging that Silvanus served as his secretary, or amanuensis. Dictation was common in the ancient Roman world (cf. Paul and Tertius; Rom. 16:22), and secretaries often could aid with syntax and grammar. So, Peter, under the superintendence of the Spirit of God, dictated the letter to Silvanus, while Silvanus, who also was a prophet (Acts 15:32), may have aided in some of the composition of the more classical Greek.</p><p>First Peter was most likely written just before or shortly after July, A.D. 64 when the city of Rome burned, thus a writing date of ca. A.D. 64&ndash;65.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>When the city of Rome burned, the Romans believed that their emperor, Nero, had set the city on fire, probably because of his incredible lust to build. In order to build more, he had to destroy what already existed.</p><p>The Romans were totally devastated. Their culture, in a sense, went down with the city. All the religious elements of their life were destroyed&mdash;their great temples, shrines, and even their household idols were burned up. This had great religious implications because it made them believe that their deities had been unable to deal with this conflagration and were also victims of it. The people were homeless and hopeless. Many had been killed. Their bitter resentment was severe, so Nero realized that he had to redirect the hostility.</p><p>The emperor&rsquo;s chosen scapegoat was the Christians, who were already hated because they were associated with Jews, and because they were seen as being hostile to the Roman culture. Nero spread the word quickly that the Christians had set the fires. As a result, a vicious persecution against Christians began, and soon spread throughout the Roman Empire, touching places N of the Taurus mountains, like Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia (1:1), and impacting the Christians, whom Peter calls &ldquo;pilgrims.&rdquo; These &ldquo;pilgrims,&rdquo; who were probably Gentiles, for the most part (1:14,18; 2:9,10; 4:3), possibly led to Christ by Paul and his associates, and established on Paul&rsquo;s teachings. But they needed spiritual strengthening because of their sufferings. Thus the Apostle Peter, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, wrote this epistle to strengthen them.</p><p>Peter wrote that he was in &ldquo;Babylon&rdquo; when he penned the letter (5:13). Three locations have been suggested for this &ldquo;Babylon.&rdquo; First, a Roman outpost in northern Egypt was named Babylon; but that place was too obscure, and there are no reasons to think that Peter was ever there. Second, ancient Bab-ylon in Mesopotamia is a possibility; but it would be quite unlikely that Peter, Mark, and Silvanus were all at this rather small, distant place at the same time. Third, &ldquo;Babylon&rdquo; is an alias for Rome; perhaps even a code word for Rome. In times of persecution, writers exercised unusual care not to endanger Christians by identifying them. Peter, according to some traditions, followed James and Paul and died as a martyr near Rome about two years after he wrote this letter, thus he had written this epistle near the end of his life, probably while staying in the imperial city. He did not want the letter to be found and the church to be persecuted, so he may have hidden its location under the code word, &ldquo;Babylon,&rdquo; which aptly fit because of the city&rsquo;s idolatry (cf. Rev. 17,18).</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>Since the believers addressed were suffering escalating persecution (1:6; 2:12,19&ndash;21; 3:9,13&ndash;18; 4:1,12&ndash;16,19), the purpose of this letter was to teach them how to live victoriously in the midst of that hostility: 1) without losing hope; 2) without becoming bitter; 3) while trusting in their Lord; and 4) while looking for His second coming. Peter wished to impress on his readers that by living an obedient, victorious life under duress, a Christian can actually evangelize his hostile world (cf. 1:14; 2:1,12,15; 3:1&ndash;6,13&ndash;17; 4:2; 5:8,9).</p><p>Believers are constantly exposed to a world system energized by Satan and his demons. Their effort is to discredit the church and to destroy its credulity and integrity. One way these spirits work is by finding Christians whose lives are not consistent with the Word of God, and then parading them before the unbelievers to show what a sham the church is. Christians, however, must stand against the enemy and silence the critics by the power of holy lives. In this epistle, Peter is rather effusive in reciting two categories of truth. The first category is positive and includes a long list of blessings bestowed on Christians. As he speaks about the identity of Christians and what it means to know Christ, Peter mentions one privilege and blessing after another. Interwoven into this list of privileges is the catalog of suffering. Christians, though most greatly privileged, should also know that the world will treat them unjustly. Their citizenship is in heaven and they are strangers in a hostile, Satan-energized world. Thus the Christian life can be summed up as a call to victory and glory through the path of suffering. So, the basic question that Peter answers in this epistle is: How are Christians to deal with animosity? The answer features practical truths and focuses on Jesus Christ as the model of one who maintained a triumphant attitude in the midst of hostility.</p><p>First Peter also answers other important practical questions about Christian living such as: Do Christians need a priesthood to intercede with God for them (2:5&ndash;9)? What should be the Christian&rsquo;s attitude to secular government and civil disobedience (2:13&ndash;17)? What should a Christian employee&rsquo;s attitude be toward a hostile employer (2:18)? How should a Christian lady conduct herself (3:3,4)? How can a believing wife win her unsaved husband to Christ (3:1,2)?</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>First Peter 3:18&ndash;22 stands as one of the most difficult NT texts to translate and then interpret. For example, does &ldquo;Spirit&rdquo; in 3:18 refer to the Holy Spirit, or to Christ&rsquo;s Spirit? Did Christ preach through Noah before the Flood, or did He preach Himself after the crucifixion (3:19)? Was the audience to this preaching composed of the humans in Noah&rsquo;s day, or demons in the abyss (3:19)? Does 3:20,21 teach baptismal regeneration (salvation), or salvation by faith alone in Christ?

"61","61","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>The clear claim to authorship in 1:1 by the Apostle Peter gives the epistle its title. To distinguish it from Peter&rsquo;s first epistle, it was given the Greek title &ldquo;<em>Petrou B,</em>&rdquo; or 2 Peter.</p><br /><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>The author of 2 Peter is the Apostle Peter (see Introduction to 1 Peter). In 1:1, he makes that claim; in 3:1, he refers to his first letter; in 1:14, he refers to the Lord&rsquo;s prediction of his death (John 21:18,19); and in 1:16&ndash;18, he claims to have been at the Transfiguration (Matt. 17:1&ndash;4). However, critics have generated more controversy over 2 Peter&rsquo;s authorship and rightful place in the canon of Scripture than over any other NT book. The church fathers were slow in giving it their acceptance. No church father refers to 2 Peter by name until Origen near the beginning of the third century. The ancient church historian, Eusebius, only included 2 Peter in his list of disputed books, along with James, Jude, 2 John, and 3 John. Even the leading Reformers only hesitatingly accepted it.</p><p>The question about differences in Greek style between the two letters has been satisfactorily answered. Peter wrote that he used an amanuensis, Silvanus, in 1 Peter (cf. 1 Pet. 5:12). In 2 Peter, Peter either used a different amanuensis or wrote the letter by himself. The differences in vocabulary between the two letters can be explained by the differences in themes. First Peter was written to help suffering Christians. Second Peter was written to expose false teachers. On the other hand, there are remarkable similarities in the vocabulary of the two books. The salutation, &ldquo;grace to you and peace be multiplied,&rdquo; is essentially the same in each book. The author uses such words as &ldquo;precious,&rdquo; &ldquo;virtue,&rdquo; &ldquo;putting off,&rdquo; and &ldquo;eyewitness,&rdquo; to name just a few examples, in both letters. Certain rather unusual words found in 2 Peter are also found in Peter&rsquo;s speeches in the Acts of the Apostles. These include &ldquo;obtained&rdquo; (1:2; Acts 1:17); &ldquo;godliness&rdquo; (1:3,6,7; 3:11; Acts 3:12); and &ldquo;wages of iniquity&rdquo; (2:13,15; Acts 1:18). Both letters also refer to the same OT event (2:5; 1 Pet. 3:18&ndash;20). Some scholars have pointed out that there are as many similarities in vocabulary between 1 and 2 Peter as there are between 1 Timothy and Titus, two letters almost universally believed to have been written by Paul.</p><p>The differences in themes also explains certain emphases, such as why one letter teaches that the second coming is near, and one deals with its delay. First Peter, ministering especially to suffering Christians, focuses on the imminency of Christ as a means of encouraging the Christians. Second Peter, dealing with scoffers, emphasizes the reasons why that imminent return of Christ has not yet occurred. Other proposed differences invented by the critics, such as the contradiction between including the resurrection of Christ in one letter and the Transfiguration of Christ in the other, seem to be contrived.</p><p>Moreover, it is seemingly irrational that a false teacher would spuriously write a letter against false teachers. No unusual, new, or false doctrines appear in 2 Peter. So, if 2 Peter were a forgery, it would be a forgery written by a fool for no reason at all. This is too much to believe. The conclusion to the question of authorship is that, when the writer introduced the letter and referred to himself as Peter, he was writing the truth.</p><p>Nero died in a.d. 68, and tradition says Peter died in Nero&rsquo;s persecution. The epistle may have been written just before his death (1:14; ca. a.d. 67&ndash;68).</p><br /><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>Since the time of the writing and sending his first letter, Peter had become increasingly concerned about false teachers who were infiltrating the churches in Asia Minor. Though these false teachers had already caused trouble, Peter expected that their heretical doctrines and immoral life-styles would result in more damage in the future. Thus Peter, in an almost last will and testament (1:13&ndash;15), wrote to warn the beloved believers in Christ about the doctrinal dangers they were facing.</p><p>Peter does not explicitly say where he was when he wrote this letter, as he does in 1 Peter (1 Pet. 5:13). But the consensus seems to be that Peter wrote this letter from prison in Rome, where he was facing imminent death. Shortly after this letter was written, Peter was martyred, according to reliable tradition, by being crucified upside down (<em>see note on John 21:18</em>).</p><p>Peter says nothing in the salutation about the recipients of this letter. But according to 3:2, Peter was writing another epistle to the same people to whom he wrote 1 Peter. In his first letter, he spelled out that he was writing &ldquo;to the pilgrims of the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia&rdquo; (1 Pet. 1:1). These provinces were located in an area of Asia Minor, which is modern Turkey. The Christians to whom Peter wrote were mostly Gentiles (<em>see note on 1:1</em>).</p><br /><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>Second Peter was written for the purpose of exposing, thwarting, and defeating the invasion of false teachers into the church. Peter intended to instruct Christians in how to defend themselves against these false teachers and their deceptive lies. This book is the most graphic and penetrating expos&eacute; of false teachers in Scripture, comparable only to Jude.</p><p>The description of the false teachers is somewhat generic. Peter does not identify some specific false religion, cult, or system of teaching. In a general characterization of false teachers, he informs that they teach destructive heresies. They deny Christ and twist the Scriptures. They bring true faith into disrepute. And they mock the second coming of Christ. But Peter was just as concerned to show the immoral character of these teachers as he was to expose their teaching. Thus, he describes them in more detail than he describes their doctrines. Wickedness is not the product of sound doctrine, but of &ldquo;destructive heresies&rdquo; (2:1).</p><p>Other themes for this letter can be discerned in the midst of Peter&rsquo;s polemic against the false teachers. He wanted to motivate his readers to continue to develop their Christian character (1:5&ndash;11). In so doing, he explains wonderfully how a believer can have assurance of his salvation. Peter also wanted to persuade his readers of the divine character of the apostolic writings (1:12&ndash;21). Near the end of the letter, he presents reasons for the delay in Christ&rsquo;s second coming (3:1&ndash;13).</p><p>Another recurring theme is the importance of knowledge. The word, &ldquo;knowledge,&rdquo; appears in some form 16 times in these 3 short chapters. It is not too much to say that Peter&rsquo;s primary solution to false teaching is knowledge of true doctrine. Other distinctive features of 2 Peter include a precise statement on the divine origin of Scripture (1:20,21); the future destruction of the world by fire (3:8&ndash;13); and the recognition of Paul&rsquo;s letters as inspired Scripture (3:15,16).</p><br /><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>Perhaps the most important challenge in the epistle is to rightly interpret 1:19&ndash;21, because of its far-reaching implications with regard to the nature and authenticity of Scripture. That passage, along with 2 Tim. 3:15&ndash;17, is vital to a sound view of the Bible&rsquo;s inspiration. Peter&rsquo;s remark that the Lord &ldquo;bought&rdquo; false teachers (2:1) poses a challenge interpretively and theologically with regard to the nature of the atonement. The identity of the angels who sinned (2:4) also challenges the interpreter. Many who believe that the saved can be lost again, use 2:18&ndash;22 for their argument. That passage, directed at false teachers, must be clarified so as not to contradict a similar statement to believers in 1:4. Further, whom does God not want to perish (3:9)? All of these matters will be treated in the notes.</p><br /><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p>Salutation (1:1, 2)</p><p><strong>I. Know Your Salvation (1:3&ndash;11)</strong></p><blockquote><p>A.

"62","62","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>The epistle&rsquo;s title has always been &ldquo;1 John.&rdquo; It is the first and largest in a series of 3 epistles that bear the Apostle John&rsquo;s name. Since the letter identifies no specific church, location, or individual to whom it was sent, its classification is as a &ldquo;general epistle.&rdquo; Although 1 John does not exhibit some of the general characteristics of an epistle common to that time (e.g., no introduction, greeting, or concluding salutation), its intimate tone and content indicate that the term &ldquo;epistle&rdquo; still applies to it.</p><br /><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>The epistle does not identify the author, but the strong, consistent and earliest testimony of the church ascribes it to John the disciple and apostle (cf. Luke 6:13,14). This anonymity strongly affirms the early church&rsquo;s identification of the epistle with John the apostle, for only someone of John&rsquo;s well known and preeminent status as an apostle would be able to write with such unmistakable authority, expecting complete obedience from his readers, without clearly identifying himself (e.g., 4:6). He was well known to the readers so he didn&rsquo;t need to mention his name.</p><p>John and James, his older brother (Acts 12:2), were known as &ldquo;the sons of Zebedee&rdquo; (Matt.10:2&ndash;4), whom Jesus gave the name &ldquo;Sons of Thunder&rdquo; (Mark 3:17). John was one of the 3most intimate associates of Jesus (along with Peter and James&mdash;cf. Matt. 17:1; 26:37), beingan eyewitness to and participant in Jesus&rsquo; earthly ministry (1:1&ndash;4). In addition to the 3 epistles,John also authored the fourth gospel, in which he identified himself as the disciple &ldquo;whomJesus loved&rdquo; and as the one who reclined on Jesus&rsquo; breast at the Last Supper (John 13:23;19:26; 20:2; 21:7,20). He also wrote the book of Revelation (Rev. 1:1).</p><p>Precise dating is difficult because no clear historical indications of date exist in 1 John. Most likely John composed this work in the latter part of the first century. Church tradition consistently identifies John in his advanced age as living and actively writing during this time at Ephesus in Asia Minor. The tone of the epistle supports this evidence since the writer gives the strong impression that he is much older than his readers (e.g., &ldquo;my little children&rdquo;&mdash;2:1,18,28). The epistle and John&rsquo;s gospel reflect similar vocabulary and manner of expression(see Historical and Theological Themes). Such similarity causes many to date the writing of</p><p>John&rsquo;s epistles as occurring soon after he composed his gospel. Since many date the gospel during the later part of the first century, they also prefer a similar date for the epistles. Furthermore, the heresy John combats most likely reflects the beginnings of Gnosticism (see Background and Setting) which was in its early stages during the latter third of the first century when John was actively writing. Since no mention is made of the persecution under Domitian, which began about A.D. 95, it may have been written before that began. In light of such factors, a reasonable date for 1 John is ca. A.D. 90&ndash;95. It was likely written from Ephesus to the churches of Asia Minor over which John exercised apostolic leadership.</p><br /><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>Although he was greatly advanced in age when he penned this epistle, John was still actively ministering to churches. He was the sole remaining apostolic survivor who had intimate, eyewitness association with Jesus throughout His earthly ministry, death, resurrection, and ascension. The church Fathers (e.g., Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, Eusebius) indicate that after that time, John lived at Ephesus in Asia Minor, carrying out an extensive evangelistic program, overseeing many of the churches that had arisen, and conducting an extensive writing ministry (e.g., epistles, The Gospel of John, and Revelation). One church Father (Papias) who had direct contact with John described him as a &ldquo;living and abiding voice.&rdquo; As the last remaining apostle, John&rsquo;s testimony was highly authoritative among the churches. Many eagerly sought to hear the one who had first-hand experience with the Lord Jesus.</p><p>Ephesus (cf. Acts 19:10) lay within the intellectual center of Asia Minor. As predicted years before by the Apostle Paul (Acts 20:28&ndash;31), false teachers arising from within the church&rsquo;s own ranks, saturated with the prevailing climate of philosophical trends, began infecting the church with false doctrine, perverting fundamental apostolic teaching. These false teachers advocated new ideas which eventually became known as &ldquo;Gnosticism&rdquo; (from the Gr. word &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;). After the Pauline battle for freedom from the law, Gnosticism was the most dangerous heresy that threatened the early church during the first 3 centuries. Most likely, John was combating the beginnings of this virulent heresy that threatened to destroy the fundamentals of the faith and the churches (see Interpretive Challenges).</p><p>Gnosticism, influenced by such philosophers as Plato, advocated a dualism asserting that matter was inherently evil and spirit was good. As a result of this presupposition, these false teachers, although attributing some form of deity to Christ, denied his true humanity to preserve Him from evil. It also claimed elevated knowledge, a higher truth known only to those in on the deep things. Only the initiated had the mystical knowledge of truth that was higher even than the Scripture</p><p>Instead of divine revelation standing as judge over man&rsquo;s ideas, man&rsquo;s ideas judged God&rsquo;s revelation (2:15&ndash;17). The heresy featured two basic forms. First, some asserted that Jesus&rsquo; physical body was not real but only &ldquo;seemed&rdquo; to be physical (known as &ldquo;Docetism&rdquo; from a Gr. word that means &ldquo;to appear&rdquo;). John forcefully affirmed the physical reality of Jesus by reminding his readers that he was an eyewitness to Him (&ldquo;heard,&rdquo; &ldquo;seen,&rdquo; &ldquo; handled,&rdquo; &ldquo;JesusChrist has come in the flesh&rdquo;&mdash;1:1&ndash;4; 4:2,3). According to early tradition (Irenaeus), another form of this heresy which John may have attacked was led by a man named Cerinthus, who contended that the Christ&rsquo;s &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; descended on the human Jesus at his baptism but left him just before his crucifixion. John wrote that the Jesus who was baptized at the beginning of His ministry was the same person who was crucified on the cross (5:6).</p><p>Such heretical views destroy not only the true humanity of Jesus, but also the atonement, for Jesus must not only have been truly God, but also the truly human (and physically real) man who actually suffered and died upon the cross in order to be the acceptable substitutionary sacrifice for sin (cf. Heb. 2:14&ndash;17). The biblical view of Jesus affirms His complete humanity as well as His full deity.</p><p>The gnostic idea that matter was evil and only spirit was good led to the idea that either the body should be treated harshly, a form of asceticism (e.g., Colossians 2:21&ndash;23), or sin committed in the body had no connection or effect on one&rsquo;s spirit. This led some, especially John&rsquo;s opponents, to conclude that sin committed in the physical body did not matter; absolute indulgence in immorality was permissible; one could deny sin even existed (1:8&ndash;10) and disregard God&rsquo;s law (3:4). John emphasized the need for obedience to God&rsquo;s laws, for he defined the true love of God as obedience to His commandments (5:3).</p><p>A lack of love for fellow believers characterizes false teachers, especially as they react against anyone rejecting their new way of thinking (3:10&ndash;18). They separated their deceived followers from the fellowship of those who remained faithful to apostolic teaching, leading John to reply that such separation outwardly manifested that those who followed false teachers lacked genuine salvation (2:19). Their departure left the other believers, who remained faithful to apostolic doctrine, shaken. Responding to this crisis, the aged apostle wrote to reassure those remaining faithful and to combat this grave threat to the church. Since the heresy was so acutely dangerous and the time period was so critical for the church in danger of being overwhelmed by false teaching, John gently, lovingly, but with unquestionable apostolic authority, sent this letter to churches in his sphere of influence to stem this spreading plague of false doctrine.</p><br /><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>In light of the circumstances of the epistle, the overall theme of 1 John is &ldquo;a recall to the fundamentals of the faith&rdquo; or &ldquo;back to the basics of Christianity.&rdquo; The apostle deals with certainties, not opinions or conjecture. He expresses the absolute character of Christianity in very simple terms; terms that are clear and unmistakable, leaving no doubt as to the fundamental nature of those truths. A warm, conversational, and above all, loving tone occurs, like a father having a tender, intimate conversation with his children.</p><p>First John also is pastoral, written from the heart of a pastor who has concern for his people. As a shepherd, John communicated to his flock some very basic, but vitally essential, principles reassuring them regarding the basics of the faith. He desired them to have joy regarding the certainty of their faith rather than being upset by the false teaching and current defections of some (1:4).</p><p>The book&rsquo;s viewpoint, however, is not only pastoral but also polemical; not only positive but also negative. John&rsquo;s refutes the defectors from sound doctrine, exhibiting no tolerance for those who pervert divine truth. He labels those departing from the truth as &ldquo;false prophets&rdquo; (4:1), &ldquo;those who try to deceive&rdquo; (2:26; 3:7), and &ldquo;antichrists&rdquo; (2:18). He pointedly identifies the ultimate source of all such defection from sound doctrine as demonic (4:1&ndash;7).</p><p>The constant repetition of 3 sub-themes reinforces the overall theme regarding faithfulness to the basics of Christianity: happiness (1:4), holiness (2:1), and security (5:13). By faithfulness to the basics, his readers will experience these 3 results continually in their lives. These 3 factors also reveal the key cycle of true spirituality in 1 John: a proper belief in Jesus produces obedience to His commands; obedience issues in love for God and fellow believers (e.g., 3:23,24). When these 3 (sound faith, obedience, love) operate in concert together, they result in happiness, holiness and assurance. They constitute the evidence, the litmus test, of a true Christian.</p><br /><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>Theologians debate the precise nature of the false teachers&rsquo; beliefs in 1 John, because John does not directly specify their beliefs, but rather combats the heretics mainly through a positive restatement of the fundamentals of the faith. The main feature of the heresy, as noted above, seems to be a denial of the incarnation, i.e., Christ had not come in the flesh. This was most likely an incipient or beginning form of Gnosticism, as was pointed out.</p><p>The interpreter is also challenged by the rigidity of John&rsquo;s theology. John presents the basics or fundamentals of the Christian life in absolute, not relative, terms. Unlike Paul, who presented exceptions, and dealt so often with believers&rsquo; failures to meet the divine standard, John does not deal with the &ldquo;what if I fail&rdquo; issues. Only in 2:1,2 does he give some relief from the absolutes. The rest of the book presents truths in black and white rather than shades of gray, often through a stark contrast, e.g., &ldquo;light&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;darkness&rdquo; (1:5,7; 2:8&ndash;11); truth vs. lies (2:21,22; 4:1); children of God vs. children of the devil (3:10). Those who claim to be Christians must absolutely display the characteristics of genuine Christians: sound doctrine, obedience, and love. Those who are truly born again have been given a new nature, which givesevidence of itself. Those who do not display characteristics of the new nature don&rsquo;t have it, sowere never truly born again. The issues do not center (as much of Paul&rsquo;s writing does) inmaintaining temporal or daily fellowship with God but the application of basic tests in one&rsquo;slife to confirm that salvation has truly occurred. Such absolute distinctions were alsocharacteristic of John&rsquo;s gospel.</p><p>In a unique fashion, John challenges the interpreter by his repetition of similar themes over and over to emphasize the basic truths about genuine Christianity. Some have likened John&rsquo;s repetition to a spiral that moves outward, becoming larger and larger, each time spreading the same truth over a wider area and encompassing more territory. Others have seen the spiral as moving inward, penetrating deeper and deeper into the same themes while expanding on his thoughts. However one views the spiraling pattern, John uses repetition of basic truths as a means to accentuate their importance and to help his readers understandand remember them.</p><br /><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I.

"63","63","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>The epistle&rsquo;s title is &ldquo;2 John.&rdquo; It is the second in a series of 3 epistles that bear the Apostle John&rsquo;s name.

Each letter could fit on a single papyrus sheet (cf.3 John 13).</p><br /><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>The author is the Apostle John. He describes himself in 2 John 1 as &ldquo;The Elder&rdquo; which conveys the advanced age of the apostle, his authority, and status during the foundational period of Christianity when he was involved with Jesus&rsquo; ministry. The precise date of the epistle cannot be determined. Since the wording, subject matter, and circumstances of 2 John closely approximate 1 John (v. 5 [cf. 1 John 2:7; 3:11]; v. 6 [cf. 1 John 5:3]; v. 7 [cf. 1 John 2:18&ndash;26]; v. 9 [cf. 1 John 2:23]; v. 12; [cf. 1 John 1:4]), most likely John composed the letter at the same time or soon after 1 John, ca. A. D. 90&ndash;95, during his ministry at Ephesus in the latterpart of his life.</p><br /><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>Second John deals with the same problem as 1 John (see Introduction to 1 John: Background and Setting). False teachers influenced by the beginnings of Gnostic thought were threatening the church (v. 7; cf. 1 John 2:18,19,22,23; 4:1&ndash;3). The strategic difference is that while 1 John has no specific individual or church specified to whom it was addressed, 2John has a particular local group or house-church in mind (v. 1).</p><p>The focus of 2 John is that the false teachers were conducting an itinerant ministry among John&rsquo;s congregations, seeking to make converts, and taking advantage of Christian hospitality to advance their cause (vv. 10,11; cf. Rom. 12:13; Heb. 13:2; 1 Pet. 4:9). The individualaddressed in the greeting (v. 1) inadvertently or unwisely may have shown these false prophets hospitality, or John may have feared that the false teachers would attempt to take advantage of her kindness (vv. 10,11). The apostle seriously warns his readers against showinghospitality to such deceivers (vv. 10,11). Although his exhortation may appear on the surface to be harsh or unloving, the acutely dangerous nature of their teaching justified such actions, especially since it threatened to destroy the very foundations of the faith (v. 9).</p><br /><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>The overall theme of 2 John closely parallels 1 John&rsquo;s theme of a &ldquo;recall to the fundamentals of the faith&rdquo; or &ldquo;back to the basics of Christianity&rdquo; (vv. 4&ndash;6). For John, the basics of Christianity are summarized by adherence to the truth (v. 4), love (v. 5), and obedience (v.6).</p><p>The apostle, however, conveys an additional but related theme in 2 John: &ldquo;the biblical guidelines for hospitality.&rdquo; Not only are Christians to adhere to the fundamentals of the faith, but the gracious hospitality that is commanded of them (Rom. 12:13) must be discriminating. The basis of hospitality must be common love of or interest in the truth, and Christians must share their love within the confines of that truth. They are not called to universal acceptance of anyone who claims to be a believer. Love must be discerning. Hospitality and kindness must be focused on those who are adhering to the fundamentals of the faith. Otherwise, Christians may actually aid those who are attempting to destroy those basic truths of thefaith. Sound doctrine must serve as the test of fellowship and the basis of separation between those who profess to be Christians and those who actually are (vv. 10,11; cf. Rom. 16:17; Gal.1:8,9; 2 Thess. 3:6,14; Titus 3:10).</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>Second John stands in direct antithesis to the frequent cry for ecumenism and Christian unity among believers. Love and truth are inseparable in Christianity. Truth must always guide the exercise of love (cf. Eph. 4:15). Love must stand the test of truth. The main lesson of this book is that truth determines the bounds of love, and as a consequence, of unity. Therefore, truth must exist before love can unite, for truth generates love (1 Pet. 1:22). When someone compromises the truth, true Christian love and unity are destroyed. Only a shallow sentimentalism exists where the truth is not the foundation of unity.</p><p>The reference to the &ldquo;elect lady and her children&rdquo; (v. 1) should be understood in a normal, plain sense referring to a particular woman and her children rather than interpreted in a non- literal sense as a church and its membership. Similarly, the reference to &ldquo;the children of your elect sister&rdquo; (v. 13) should be understood as a reference to the nieces and/or nephews of the individual addressed in verse 1, rather than metaphorically to a sister church and its membership. In these verses, John conveys greetings to personal acquaintances that he has come to know through his ministry.</p><br /><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p>I.

"64","64","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>The epistle&rsquo;s title is &ldquo;3 John.&rdquo; It is the third in a series of 3 epistles that bear the Apostle John&rsquo;s name. Third John and 2 John present the closest approximation in the New Testament to the conventional letter form of the contemporary Greco-Roman world, since they were addressed from an individual to individuals. Both 2 and 3 John are the shortest epistles in the NT, each containing less than 300 Greek words, so as to fit on a single papyrus sheet (cf. v. 13).</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>The author is the Apostle John. He describes himself in v. 1 as &ldquo;The Elder&rdquo; which conveys the advanced age of the apostle, his authority and his eyewitness status especially during the foundational period of Christianity when John was involved with Jesus&rsquo; ministry (cf. 2 John 1). The precise date of the epistle cannot be determined. Since the structure, style, and vocabulary closely approximate 2 John (v. 1 [cf. 2 John 1]; v. 4 [cf. 2 John 4]; v. 13 [cf. 2 John 12]; v. 14 [cf. 2 John 12]), most likely John composed the letter at the same time or soon after 2 John, ca. A.D. 90&ndash;95. As with 1 and 2 John, the apostle probably composed the letter during his ministry at Ephesus in the latter part of his life.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>Third John is perhaps the most personal of John&rsquo;s 3 epistles. While 1 John appears to be a general letter addressed to congregations scattered throughout Asia Minor, and 2 John was sent to a lady and her family (2 John 1), in 3 John the apostle clearly names the sole recipient as &ldquo;the beloved Gaius&rdquo; (v. 1). This makes the epistle one of a few letters in the NT addressed strictly to an individual (cf. Philemon). The name &ldquo;Gaius&rdquo; was very common in the first century (e.g., Acts 19:29; 20:4; Rom. 16:23; 1 Cor. 1:14), but nothing is known of this individual beyond John&rsquo;s salutation, from which it is inferred that he was a member of one of the churches under John&rsquo;s spiritual oversight.</p><p>As with 2 John, 3 John focuses on the basic issue of hospitality but from a different perspective. While 2 John warns against showing hospitality to false teachers (2 John 7&ndash;11), 3 John condemns the lack of hospitality shown to faithful ministers of the Word (vv. 9,10). Reports came back to the apostle that itinerant teachers known and approved by him (vv. 5&ndash;8) had traveled to a certain congregation where they were refused hospitality (e.g., lodging and provision) by an individual named Diotrephes who domineered the assembly (v. 10). Diotrephes went even further, for he also verbally slandered the Apostle John with malicious accusations and excluded anyone from the assembly who dared challenge him (v. 10).</p><p>In contrast, Gaius, a beloved friend of the apostle and faithful adherent to the truth (vv. 1&ndash;4), extended the correct standard of Christian hospitality to itinerant ministers. John wrote to commend the type of hospitality exhibited by Gaius to worthy representatives of the gospel (vv. 6&ndash;8) and to condemn the high-handed actions of Diotrephes (v. 10). The apostle promised to correct the situation personally and sent this letter through an individual named Demetrius, whom he commended for his good testimony among the brethren (vv. 10&ndash;12).</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>The theme of 3 John is the commendation of the proper standards of Christian hospitality and the condemnation for failure to follow those standards.</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>Some think that Diotrephes may either have been a heretical teacher or at least favored the false teachers who were condemned by 2 John. However, the epistle gives no clear evidence to warrant such a conclusion, especially since one might expect that John would have mentioned Diotrephes&rsquo; heretical views. The epistle indicates that his problems centered around arrogance and disobedience, which is a problem for the orthodox as well as the heretic.</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I.

"65","65","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>Jude, which is rendered &ldquo;Judah&rdquo; in Hebrew and &ldquo;Judas&rdquo; in Greek, was named after its author (v. 1), one of the 4 half-brothers of Christ (Matt. 13:55; Mark 6:3). As the fourth shortest NT book (Philem., 2 John, and 3 John are shorter), Jude is the last of 8 general epistles. Jude does not quote the OT directly, but there are at least 9 obvious allusions to it. Contextually, this &ldquo;epistolary sermon&rdquo; could be called &ldquo;The Acts of the Apostates.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>Although Jude (Judas) was a common name in Palestine (at least 8 are named in the NT), the author of Jude generally has been accepted as Jude, Christ&rsquo;s half-brother. He is to be differentiated from the Apostle Judas, the son of James (Luke 6:16; Acts 1:13). Several lines of thought lead to this conclusion: 1) Jude&rsquo;s appeal to being the &ldquo;brother of James,&rdquo; the leader of the Jerusalem Council (Acts 15) and another half-brother of Jesus (v. 1; cf. Gal. 1:19); 2) Jude&rsquo;s salutation being similar to James (cf. James 1:1); and 3) Jude&rsquo;s not identifying himself as an apostle (v. 1), but rather distinguishing between himself and the apostles (v. 17).</p><p>The doctrinal and moral apostasy discussed by Jude (vv. 4&ndash;18) closely parallels that of 2 Peter (2:1&ndash;3:4), and it is believed that Peter&rsquo;s writing predated Jude for several reasons: 1) 2 Peter anticipates the coming of false teachers (2 Pet. 2:1,2; 3:3), while Jude deals with their arrival (vv. 4,11,12,17,18); and 2) Jude quotes directly from 2 Pet. 3:3 and acknowledges that it is from an apostle (vv. 17,18). Since no mention of Jerusalem&rsquo;s destruction in A.D. 70 was made by Jude, though Jude most likely came after 2 Peter (ca. A.D. 68&ndash;70), it was almost certainly written before the destruction of Jerusalem. Although Jude did travel on missionary trips with other brothers and their wives (1 Cor. 9:5), it is most likely that he wrote from Jerusalem. The exact audience of believers with whom Jude corresponded is unknown, but seems to be Jewish in light of Jude&rsquo;s illustrations. He undoubtedly wrote to a region recently plagued by false teachers.</p><p>Although Jude had earlier rejected Jesus as Messiah (John 7:1&ndash;9), he, along with other half-brothers of our Lord, was converted after Christ&rsquo;s resurrection (Acts 1:14). Because of his relation to Jesus, his eye-witness knowledge of the resurrected Christ, and the content of this epistle, it was acknowledged as inspired and was included in the Muratorian Canon (A.D. 170).</p><p>The early questions about its canonicity also tend to support that it was written after 2 Peter. If Peter had quoted Jude, there would have been no question about canonicity, since Peter would thereby have given Jude apostolic affirmation. Clement of Rome (ca. A.D. 96) plus Clement of Alexandria (ca. A.D. 200) also alluded to the authenticity of Jude. Its diminutive size and Jude&rsquo;s quotations from uninspired writings, account for any misplaced questions about its canonicity.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>Jude lived at a time when Christianity was under severe political attack from Rome and aggressive spiritual infiltration from gnostic-like apostates and libertines who sowed abundant seed for a gigantic harvest of doctrinal error. It could be that this was the forerunner to full blown Gnosticism which the Apostle John would confront over 25 years later in his epistles. Except for John, who lived at the close of the century, all of the other apostles had been martyred, and Christianity was thought to be extremely vulnerable. Thus, Jude called the church to fight, in the midst of intense spiritual warfare, for the truth.</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>Jude is the only NT book devoted exclusively to confronting &ldquo;apostasy,&rdquo; meaning defection from the true, biblical faith (vv. 3,17). Apostates are described elsewhere in 2 Thess. 2:10; Heb. 10:29; 2 Pet. 2:1&ndash;22; 1 John 2:18&ndash;23. He wrote to condemn the apostates and to urge believers to contend for the faith. He called for discernment on the part of the church and a rigorous defense of biblical truth. He followed the earlier examples of: 1) Christ (Matt. 7:15ff.; 16:6&ndash;12; 24:11ff; Rev. 2,3); 2) Paul (Acts 20:29,30; 1 Tim. 4:1; 2 Tim. 3:1&ndash;5; 4:3,4); 3) Peter (2 Pet. 2:1,2; 3:3,4); and 4) John (1 John 4:1&ndash;6; 2 John 6&ndash;11).</p><p>Jude is replete with historical illustrations from the OT which include: 1) the Exodus (v. 5); 2) Satan&rsquo;s rebellion (v. 6); 3) Sodom and Gomorrah (v. 7); 4) Moses&rsquo; death (v. 9); 5) Cain (v. 11); 6) Balaam (v. 11); 7) Korah (v. 11); 8) Enoch (vv. 14,15); and 9) Adam (v. 14).</p><p>Jude also vividly described the apostates in terms of their character and unconscionable activities (vv. 4,8,10,16,18,19). Additionally, he borrowed from nature to illustrate the futility of their teaching (vv. 12,13). While Jude never commented on the specific content of their false teaching, it was enough to demonstrate that their degenerate personal lives and fruitless ministries betrayed their attempts to teach error as though it were truth. This emphasis on character repeats the constant theme regarding false teachers&mdash;their personal corruption. While their teaching is clever, subtle, deceptive, enticing, and delivered in myriads of forms, the common way to recognize them is to look behind their false spiritual fronts and see their wicked lives (2 Pet. 2:10,12,18,19).</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>Because there are no doctrinal issues discussed, the challenges of this letter have to do with interpretation in the normal process of discerning the meaning of the text. Jude does quote from non-canonical, pseudepigraphal (i.e., the actual author was not the one named in its title) sources such as 1 Enoch (v. 14) and the Assumption of Moses (v. 9) to support his points. Was this acceptable? Since Jude was writing under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit (2 Tim. 3:16; 2 Pet. 1:20,21) and included material that was accurate and true in its affirmations, he did no differently than Paul (cf. Acts 17:28; 1 Cor. 15:33; Titus 1:12).</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I. Desires of Jude (1,2)</strong></p><p><strong>II.

"66","66","<p><strong>Title</strong></p><p>Unlike most books of the Bible, Revelation contains its own title: &ldquo;The Revelation of Jesus Christ&rdquo; (1:1). &ldquo;Revelation&rdquo; (Gr., <em>apokalupsis</em>) means &ldquo;an uncovering,&rdquo; &ldquo;an unveiling,&rdquo; or &ldquo;a disclosure.&rdquo; In the NT, this word describes the unveiling of spiritual truth (Rom. 16:25; Gal. 1:12; Eph. 1:17; 3:3), the revealing of the sons of God (Rom. 8:19), Christ&rsquo;s incarnation (Luke 2:32), and His glorious appearing at His second coming (2 Thess. 1:7; 1 Pet. 1:7). In all its uses, &ldquo;revelation&rdquo; refers to something or someone, once hidden, becoming visible. What this book reveals or unveils is Jesus Christ in glory. Truths about Him and His final victory, that the rest of Scripture merely allude to, become clearly visible through revelation about Jesus Christ (see Historical and Theological Themes). This revelation was given to Him by God the Father, and it was communicated to the Apostle John by an angel (1:1).</p><p><strong>Author and Date</strong></p><p>Four times the author identifies himself as John (1:1,4,9; 22:8). Early tradition unanimously identified him as John the apostle, author of the fourth gospel and three epistles. For example, important second century witnesses to the Apostle John&rsquo;s authorship include Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, and Tertullian. Many of the book&rsquo;s original readers were still alive during the lifetimes of Justin Martyr and Irenaeus&mdash;both of whom held to apostolic authorship.</p><p>There are differences in style between Revelation and John&rsquo;s other writings, but they are insignificant and do not preclude one man from writing both. In fact, there are some striking parallels between Revelation and John&rsquo;s other works. Only John&rsquo;s gospel and Revelation refer to Jesus Christ as the Word (19:13; John 1:1). Revelation (1:7) and John&rsquo;s gospel (19:37) translate Zech. 12:10 differently from the Septuagint, but in agreement with each other. Only Revelation and the Gospel of John describe Jesus as the Lamb (5:6,8; John 1:29); both describe Jesus as a witness (cf. 1:5; John 5:31,32).</p><p>Revelation was written in the last decade of the first century (ca. A.D. 94&ndash;96), near the end of Emperor Domitian&rsquo;s reign (A.D. 81&ndash;96). Although some date it during Nero&rsquo;s reign (A.D. 54&ndash;68), their arguments are unconvincing and conflict with the view of the early church. Writing in the second century, Irenaeus declared that Revelation had been written toward the end of Domitian&rsquo;s reign. Later writers, such as Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Victorinus (who wrote one of the earliest commentaries on Revelation), Eusebius, and Jerome affirm the Domitian date.</p><p>The spiritual decline of the 7 churches (chaps. 2,3) also argues for the later date. Those churches were strong and spiritually healthy in the mid-60s, when Paul last ministered in Asia Minor. The brief time between Paul&rsquo;s ministry there and the end of Nero&rsquo;s reign was too short for such a decline to have occurred. The longer time gap also explains the rise of the heretical sect known as the Nicolaitans (2:6,15), who are not mentioned in Paul&rsquo;s letters, not even to one or more of these same churches (Ephesians). Finally, dating Revelation during Nero&rsquo;s reign does not allow time for John&rsquo;s ministry in Asia Minor to reach the point at which the authorities would have felt the need to exile him.</p><p><strong>Background and Setting</strong></p><p>Revelation begins with John, the last surviving apostle and an old man, in exile on the small, barren island of Patmos, located in the Aegean Sea southwest of Ephesus. The Roman authorities had banished him there because of his faithful preaching of the gospel (1:9). While on Patmos, John received a series of visions that laid out the future history of the world.</p><p>When he was arrested, John was in Ephesus, ministering to the church there and in the surrounding cities. Seeking to strengthen those congregations, he could no longer minister to them in person and, following the divine command (1:11), John addressed Revelation to them (1:4). The churches had begun to feel the effects of persecution; at least one man&mdash;probably a pastor&mdash;had already been martyred (2:13), and John himself had been exiled. But the storm of persecution was about to break in full fury upon the 7 churches so dear to the apostle&rsquo;s heart (2:10). To those churches, Revelation provided a message of hope: God is in sovereign control of all the events of human history, and though evil often seems pervasive and wicked men all powerful, their ultimate doom is certain. Christ will come in glory to judge and rule.</p><p><strong>Historical and Theological Themes</strong></p><p>Since it is primarily prophetic, Revelation contains little historical material, other than that in chaps. 1&ndash;3. The 7 churches to whom the letter was addressed were existing churches in Asia Minor (modern Turkey). Apparently, they were singled out because John had ministered in them.</p><p>Revelation is first and foremost a revelation about Jesus Christ (1:1). The book depicts Him as the risen, glorified Son of God ministering among the churches (1:10ff.), as &ldquo;the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler over the kings of the earth&rdquo; (1:5), as &ldquo;the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End&rdquo; (1:8), as the one &ldquo;who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty&rdquo; (1:8), as the First and the Last (1:11), as the Son of Man (1:13), as the one who was dead, but now is alive forevermore (1:18), as the Son of God (2:18), as the one who is holy and true (3:7), as &ldquo;the Amen, the Faithful and True Witness, the Beginning of the creation of God&rdquo; (3:14), as the Lion of the tribe of Judah (5:5), as the Lamb in heaven, with authority to open the title deed to the earth (6:1ff.), as the Lamb on the throne (7:17), as the Messiah who will reign forever (11:15), as the Word of God (19:13), as the majestic King of kings and Lord of lords, returning in glorious splendor to conquer His foes (19:11ff.), and as &ldquo;the Root and the Offspring of David, the Bright and Morning Star&rdquo; (22:16).</p><p>Many other rich theological themes find expression in Revelation. The church is warned about sin and exhorted to holiness. John&rsquo;s vivid pictures of worship in heaven both exhort and instruct believers. In few other books of the Bible is the ministry of angels so prominent. Revelation&rsquo;s primary theological contribution is to eschatology, i.e., the doctrine of last things. In it we learn about: the final political setup of the world; the last battle of human history; the career and ultimate defeat of Antichrist; Christ&rsquo;s 1,000 year earthly kingdom; the glories of heaven and the eternal state; and the final state of the wicked and the righteous. Finally, only Daniel rivals this book in declaring that God providentially rules over the kingdoms of men and will accomplish His sovereign purposes regardless of human or demonic opposition.</p><p><strong>Interpretive Challenges</strong></p><p>No other NT book poses more serious and difficult interpretive challenges than Revelation. The book&rsquo;s vivid imagery and striking symbolism have produced 4 main interpretive approaches:</p><p>The <em>preterist</em> approach interprets Revelation as a description of first century events in the Roman Empire (see Author and Date). This view conflicts with the book&rsquo;s own often repeated claim to be prophecy (1:3; 22:7,10,18,19). It is impossible to see all the events in Revelation as<br />already fulfilled. The second coming of Christ, for example, obviously did not take place in the first century.</p><p>The <em>historicist </em>approach views Revelation as a panoramic view of church history from apostolic times to the present&mdash;seeing in the symbolism such events as the barbarian invasions of Rome, the rise of the Roman Catholic Church (as well as various individual popes), the emergence of Islam, and the French Revolution. This interpretive method robs Revelation of any meaning for those to whom it was written. It also ignores the time limitations the book itself places on the unfolding events (cf. 11:2; 12:6,14; 13:5). Historicism has produced many different&mdash;and often conflicting&mdash;interpretations of the actual historical events contained in Revelation.</p><p>The <em>idealist</em> approach interprets Revelation as a timeless depiction of the cosmic struggle between the forces of good and evil. In this view, the book contains neither historical allusions nor predictive prophecy. This view also ignores Revelation&rsquo;s prophetic character and, if carried to its logical conclusion, severs the book from any connection with actual historical events. Revelation then becomes merely a collection of stories designed to teach spiritual truth.</p><p>The <em>futurist</em> approach insists that the events of chaps. 6&ndash;22 are yet future, and that those chapters literally and symbolically depict actual people and events yet to appear on the world scene. It describes the events surrounding the second coming of Jesus Christ (chaps. 6&ndash;19), the Millennium and final judgment (chap. 20), and the eternal state (chaps. 21,22). Only this view does justice to Revelation&rsquo;s claim to be prophecy and interprets the book by the same grammatical-historical method as chaps. 1&ndash;3 and the rest of Scripture.</p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><p><strong>I.
